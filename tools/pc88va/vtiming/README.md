# V480PAT: PC-88VA display-timing test pattern

`V480PAT.COM` is a PC-Engine (V3 mode) program that draws a 16-colour test
pattern in graphics screen 0 and can switch the display to non-standard line
counts by sending its own TSP `SYNC` vector. It was written for vaeg M104 to
measure, on real hardware, which display timings the PC-88VA and a monitor
accept, and how the graphics fetch behaves outside the documented 200/204/
400/408-line modes. The source, [`v480pat.asm`](v480pat.asm), is distributed
under the repository's two-clause BSD terms.

It is an independent program. It complements, but does not contain,
[VIEW480](http://www.pc88.gr.jp/softlib/index.php?action=list_file&anum=2&gnum=404)
(mami, 1992), which shows a 640x480 picture by reprogramming the TSP for 480
lines; VIEW480 is not redistributed here. The development-disk builder
builds `VIEW480.COM` from its public source archive (see
[`pc88va-utility-media.md`](../../../docs/modernization/pc88va-utility-media.md)).

> [!WARNING]
> Non-standard `SYNC` timings can be out of range for a monitor. Fixed-
> frequency CRTs in particular should not be left driven by an out-of-range
> signal. Every switching option restores the previous timing on any key;
> if the screen is lost, press a key or switch the machine off.

## Binary

[`bin/v480pat.com`](bin/v480pat.com) is the program run on real hardware
for the second round of measurements, published as a proof of concept; it
predates the `R` option. It is
assembled from [`v480pat.asm`](v480pat.asm) at commit
[`290d976c`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/290d976c48f553b7256d82fa4e41edc61c0c5c9d)
with NASM 2.16.01 (`nasm -f bin`) and is byte-identical to the CMake build of
that source: 2,008 bytes, SHA-256
`553ffd5fa87365be91980cadd310daa87425c5475541c1faf9dbaa417ca2f59c`. Copy it
to a PC-Engine disk as `V480PAT.COM`. The same two-clause BSD terms apply.

## Building

The CMake build assembles it with NASM to `build/<preset>/guest/v480pat.com`;
the source is restricted to 8086/80186 instructions (`cpu 186`), so an
assembler choice that would emit 80386 forms fails the build. A PC-Engine 1.1
test disk is made from the user's own system disk:

```sh
tools/pc88va/build-vtiming-disk.sh \
    --source /path/to/pc-engine-1.1-system.d88 \
    --output /path/to/vtiming.d88 \
    [--view480 /path/to/VIEW480.COM]
```

The system disk is private media; keep both images outside Git.

## Usage

```text
V480PAT [lines] [S|T|U|R|D|I] [Hnn] [W] [N] [K] [Z] [Q|P]
V480PAT A|B|C|E|F
```

| Argument | Effect |
|---|---|
| `lines` | 1-480 (default 480). Graphics screen 0 is set up through the graphics BIOS (`INT 8Fh`) as single-plane 4 bits/pixel, 640 dots, with a frame buffer `lines` high, and the pattern is drawn directly into GVRAM. |
| none of S/T/U/D | The pattern is left on the normal screen (400 lines visible), for VIEW480 or a capture. |
| `S` | 24.8 kHz: VIEW480's sequence with `VAD = lines`; above 400 lines the bottom blanking and sync become 1 and 1 (VIEW480's values), below that the ROM's 7 and 8 stay. The frame grows or shrinks with `lines`. |
| `T` | 15.98 kHz, monitor switch at 15 kHz. Graphics in 200-line mode (one raster per line). `lines` 4-256, rounded down to even. Top blanking 32, sync 4, bottom blanking at least 2 and grown to keep a frame of at least 262 lines: the uPD72022 data-book minimums with sprites. |
| `U` | As `T` with top blanking 16 (the data-book minimum without sprites). |
| `R` | As `T` with top blanking 37, the ROM's 15.98 kHz value; by the measured rule graphics then show all `lines` (224: 267-line frame, 59.9 Hz; 240: 283 lines, 56.5 Hz). |
| `Hnn` | As `R` with top blanking `nn` (1-63), for values above 37 that the other options do not reach. |
| `I` | 15.73 kHz family, monitor switch at 15 kHz: as `R` but starting from the ROM's 15.73 kHz 200-line vector (`C1 47 1C 00 9F 00 12 11 24 00 C8 00 17 04`: top 36, external sync) with port `0100h` RSM = 10 (interlaced mode 0), the pairing the ROM uses for that family. `Hnn` after `I` changes the top. |
| `D` | 24.8 kHz, 320 x `lines` (1-240) line-doubled: graphics in 200-line mode with port `0100h` RSM = 01 (non-interlaced mode 1), the TSP frame at 2 x `lines` rasters; above 400 rasters bottom blanking 2 and sync 4. |
| `W` | Graphics screen 0 at 320 dots (`0102h` bit 4) with `S`, `T`, `U` or none; `D` is always 320. |
| `N` | With `S`, `T`, `U` or `D`: TSP horizontal active `HAD` 159 -> 127 (128 TCK: 256 dots at 320, 512 at 640) and 16 TCK added to each of `LBR` and `RBR`, keeping the line length. Two white two-dot marks show the edges of that window. |
| `Q` | With `S`: bottom blanking 1 and sync 1 at any line count (otherwise only above 400 lines). |
| `P` | With `S`: bottom blanking 2 and sync 4 (the data-book minimums). With `K`, `Q` and `P` shorten the 24.8 kHz frame towards 60 Hz. |
| `Z` | With `D`: RSM = 00 (non-interlaced mode 0, odd rasters blank) instead of 01. |
| `K` | With `S` or `D`: top blanking 17 instead of the ROM's 25 (480 lines with `S`: 499-line frame, about 49.8 Hz). |

Any key restores the timing (and RSM for `D`). The graphics mode chosen for
the pattern is left in place, so after `D` or `T` the pattern stays in
200-line mode.

`A` and `B` run a fixed list of argument sets one after another, so a
series needs no typing: each entry runs exactly as if typed after
`V480PAT` (the label shows it), any key restores the timing and goes on to
the next entry, and ESC stops. If the monitor shows nothing for an entry,
a key still moves on; the entries are numbered below to keep count.

| List | Monitor switch | Entries, in order |
|---|---|---|
| `A` | 24 kHz | 1 `400 S`, 2 `408 S`, 3 `416 S`, 4 `420 S`, 5 `424 S`, 6 `432 S`, 7 `440 S`, 8 `448 S`, 9 `456 S`, 10 `464 S`, 11 `472 S`, 12 `476 S`, 13 `480 S`, 14 `440 S W`, 15 `440 S N`, 16 `480 S W`, 17 `464 S K`, 18 `472 S K`, 19 `480 S K`, 20 `200 D`, 21 `240 D`, 22 `232 D K`, 23 `240 D K` |
| `B` | 15 kHz | 1 `200 R W`, 2 `208 R W`, 3 `216 R W`, 4 `224 R W`, 5 `232 R W`, 6 `236 R W`, 7 `240 R W`, 8 `244 R W`, 9 `248 R W`, 10 `224 R`, 11 `240 R`, 12 `240 R W N`, 13 `240 T W`, 14 `240 U W` |
| `C` | 15 kHz | 1 `200 H37 W`, 2 `200 H41 W`, 3 `200 H45 W`, 4 `200 H53 W`, 5 `224 H45 W`, 6 `240 H41 W`, 7 `240 H45 W`, 8 `200 I W`, 9 `224 I W`, 10 `240 I W`, 11 `240 I W H37`, 12 `240 I` |
| `E` | 24 kHz | 1 `200 D`, 2 `200 D Z`, 3 `232 D Z`, 4 `240 D K Z` |
| `F` | 24 kHz | 1 `400 S` (440 lines, 56.42 Hz), 2 `400 S Q` (427, 58.14), 3 `400 S K Q` (419, 59.25), 4 `400 S K P` (423, 58.69), 5 `400 S W K Q` (419, 59.25), 6 `396 S K Q` (415, 59.82), 7 `394 S K Q` (413, 60.11), 8 `392 S K Q` (411, 60.40), 9 `392 S K P` (415, 59.82), 10 `384 S K Q` (403, 61.60) |

`C` measures top blankings above 37 at 15.98 kHz (the graphics window
for `TBL > 37` is not modelled) and the 15.73 kHz family; `E` measures
line doubling with RSM = 00; `F` measures 640-dot frames near 60 Hz
(vaeg's line rate; the rates are derived). These conditions were not reached by `A` and
`B`, which is why vaeg does not model them yet.

## Timings

Frame totals follow `TBL + TBR + VAD + BBR + BBL + VS`; rates use vaeg's
dot clocks (24.83 kHz and 15.98 kHz lines) and are derived values, not
measurements.

| Command | Lines (top / active / bottom / sync) | Frame | Vertical rate |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| normal 400-line screen | 25 / 400 / 7 / 8 | 440 | 56.4 Hz |
| `VIEW480` | 25 / 480 / 1 / 1 | 507 | 49.0 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 S` | 25 / 240 / 7 / 8 | 280 | 88.7 Hz |
| `V480PAT 232 D` | 25 / 464 rasters / 2 / 4 | 495 | 50.2 Hz |
| `V480PAT 472 S` | 25 / 472 / 1 / 1 | 499 | 49.8 Hz |
| `V480PAT 476 S` | 25 / 476 / 1 / 1 | 503 | 49.4 Hz |
| `V480PAT 480 S K` | 17 / 480 / 1 / 1 | 499 | 49.8 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 D K` | 17 / 480 rasters / 2 / 4 | 503 | 49.4 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 D` | 25 / 480 rasters / 2 / 4 | 511 | 48.6 Hz |
| normal 15 kHz 200-line screen | 37 / 200 / 15 / 8 | 260 | 61.5 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 T W` | 32 / 240 / 2 / 4 | 278 | 57.5 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 U W` | 16 / 240 / 2 / 4 | 262 | 61.0 Hz |
| `V480PAT 224 U W` | 16 / 224 / 18 / 4 | 262 | 61.0 Hz |
| `V480PAT 224 R W` | 37 / 224 / 2 / 4 | 267 | 59.9 Hz |
| `V480PAT 232 R W` | 37 / 232 / 2 / 4 | 275 | 58.1 Hz |
| `V480PAT 240 R W` | 37 / 240 / 2 / 4 | 283 | 56.5 Hz |

## Reading the pattern

- Left half: 40-line colour bands (colours 1-14 repeating). Right half:
  sixteen vertical bars, colours 0-15.
- Top left: the command line (`V480PAT` and its arguments, upper case) in
  white on black, drawn into graphics with a built-in 5x7 font at 2x2 dots,
  so photographs identify the run even when the TSP text is disturbed.
- White full-width lines every 100 lines and on the last line; red lines at
  lines 399/400, or 199/200 at 320 dots.
- Ruler: from line 192 down to the larger of `lines` and 264, a bar at the
  left edge. GVRAM is cleared that far first, so the ruler below the last
  line shows how far the display reads graphics past it. Its length is
  `(y mod 8) + 1` steps (8 dots at 640, 4 at 320); its colour gives
  `y div 8`:

| Colour | Lines | | Colour | Lines |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| white | 192-199, 256-263 | | cyan | 224-231 |
| red | 200-207, 264-271 | | blue | 232-239 |
| yellow | 208-215 | | magenta | 240-247 |
| green | 216-223 | | light grey | 248-255 |

  The pattern repeats every 64 lines (480-line runs continue it). The last
  visible line is the last bar's colour and length; for example a green bar
  four steps long is line 219.

## TSPMODE: undocumented TSP screen modes

[`tspmode.asm`](tspmode.asm) builds `TSPMODE.COM` (same terms), also put on
the test disk by `build-vtiming-disk.sh`. The PC-88VA technical manual
states that the TSP itself has text, sprite, semigraphics, graphics and
uPD3301-emulation functions but that the VA uses only text, sprites and
the emulation; it documents attribute `MODE` values 0-5 in bits 4:0 of
word `0Ah` of each screen-table entry. The uPD72022 data sheet describes
semigraphics (video memory read as pattern codes selecting pattern data
with format and colour) and graphics (video memory shown directly as
colour) static-picture modes, without the selection encoding in the
material at hand.

```text
TSPMODE [first]
```

It writes character codes 00h-FFh as a 16 x 16 block (attribute F0h) into
the main split, sets that split's `MODE` to `first` (default 0) and steps
it up to 31 on each key; repeats of a held key are dropped, ESC stops. The
current value is shown as `MODE nn` at the left of the function-key row.
The display timing is not changed, and the TVRAM cells and `MODE` words it
touched are restored on exit. Values 0-5 are the documented attribute
modes; anything other than characters (patterns, colour fields, dots) at
6-31 would point at an undocumented static-picture mode.

## TSPFILL: known data under the undocumented modes

[`tspfill.asm`](tspfill.asm) builds `TSPFILL.COM` (same terms), also put on
the test disk.

```text
TSPFILL [mode]
TSPFILL A
```

`MODE` 8-14 (and 24-30) replace the whole main split by a non-character
pattern on the PC-88VA2. TSPFILL sets split 0's `MODE` to `mode` (default
8) and fills TVRAM from split 0's start address up to the screen table
(`7F00h`), and the same range of the attribute area (`+8000h`), with known
data; each key steps to the next fill, ESC stops, and `MODE nn Pn` is shown
at the left of the function-key row. For a byte at TVRAM offset `o`
(character and attribute areas alike unless noted):

| Fill | Data |
|---|---|
| `P0` | 00h |
| `P1` | FFh |
| `P2` | characters FFh, attributes 00h |
| `P3` | characters 00h, attributes FFh |
| `P4` | `o and FFh` (byte ramp) |
| `P5` | `(o shr 4) and FFh` (changes every 16 bytes) |
| `P6` | `(o shr 8) and FFh` (changes every 256 bytes) |
| `P7` | nibbles 0, 1, ..., F repeated, high nibble first |

If the pattern follows the fills, the TSP reads this TVRAM in these modes:
uniform screens for `P0`-`P3` tell which area it reads, the stripe and band
widths of `P4`-`P7` give the bytes per dot, per raster and per row. The
filled range and the `MODE` word are saved in a 64 KiB block (INT 21h
function 48h) and restored on exit; the timing is not changed. vaeg draws
these modes as text, so its screen is not a reference.

`A` runs unattended, for filming: `MODE` 8, 12, 14, 10 and 13 in turn,
each with `P0`-`P7` held for about 3 seconds (170 frames after each fill,
which itself takes a moment), then it restores TVRAM and exits by itself.
Any key stops it early. The label may be unreadable in some modes; the
order is fixed, so the step can be counted from the start of `P0`.

## G160: 160 x 100 with a colour per dot

[`g160.asm`](g160.asm) builds `G160.COM` (same terms), also put on the test
disk.

```text
G160 [16|8|4|A]
```

Graphics screen 0 becomes single-plane 320 x 200 at 16, 8 or 4 bits per
pixel (default 16) in 320-dot and 200-line mode, with port `0100h` RSM = 01
so that 24.8 kHz shows every line on two rasters (measured in M104). The
hardware enlarges 2 x 2 and the CPU writes each picture dot as 2 x 2
pixels, so a dot is 4 x 4 screen dots. The SGP is not used: BitBlt copies
blocks and has no enlargement. The picture (a moving gradient with a
32 x 32 block of one-dot checks at the top left) is computed and redrawn
in full until a key; then `G160 nn-bit N redraws hh:mm:ss-hh:mm:ss`
(the start and end calendar-clock values, each byte as two hexadecimal
digits) appears in the function-key row until a second key. The rate includes computing every
dot's colour, so it is a lower bound for plain copying.

PC-Engine's `INT 21h` provides only file, memory and process functions
(technical manual chapter 7): there is no console output or time call. The
time comes from the calendar clock BIOS (`INT 8Ch` function 02h, whole
seconds), so run for ten seconds or more; the result is written to TVRAM.
Under vaeg (2026-10-06, emulated time, `--nowait`) 16, 8 and 4 bits gave
98 redraws in 34 s, 112 in 33 s and 138 in 33 s.

`[MEAS]` On the PC-88VA2 (2026-10-06, 24.8 kHz monitor setting) `G160`
shows the one-dot checks at the top left and a gradient moving slowly
upwards, as in vaeg: single-plane graphics in 320-dot and 200-line mode
with RSM = 01 show a 160 x 100 picture with a colour per dot. Rates on the
hardware: `G160 8` gave 91 redraws in 59 s (1.5 per second; vaeg 3.4), so
vaeg runs this loop about 2.2 times faster than the PC-88VA2. A 16-bit run
gave 189 redraws but an impossible computed time (3494 s), so the program
now shows the raw clock values instead of a computed time. The calendar
BIOS returns binary, not BCD, values, in vaeg and on the PC-88VA2. With
the raw values the PC-88VA2 gave 1.4, 1.6 and 1.9 redraws per second at 16,
8 and 4 bits (24.8 kHz; about the same at 15.98 kHz), against 3.0, 3.4 and
4.25 in vaeg (`pc88va-video-modes.md` section 12.4).

`A` runs 16, 8 and 4 bits one after another; each needs the usual two
keys (stop drawing, then leave the result line).

## G256: a 256 x 192 window

[`g256.asm`](g256.asm) builds `G256.COM` (same terms), also put on the test
disk.

```text
G256 [16|8|4|A]
```

The VA has no 256-dot graphics mode, and the TSP horizontal active period
does not clip graphics, so 256 x 192 is shown as a window in single-plane
320 x 200 graphics (320-dot and 200-line mode): GVRAM x 32-287, y 4-195,
black outside, pixels 1:1 with GVRAM at 16, 8 or 4 bits (default 16). 192
lines fit the native 200-line mode, so no `SYNC` change is made and the
same program runs with the monitor switch at 15 or 24 kHz: at 15.98 kHz
each line is one raster (about 61.5 Hz), at 24.8 kHz port `0100h` RSM = 01
shows it on two rasters (56.4 Hz). The window has a white one-dot border,
a grey grid every 32 dots, one-dot red/white checks in its top-left
32 x 32 cell and a gradient; line 1 carries one white dot per bit of depth
(16, 8 or 4 dots at the top left). Any key restores the screen. `A` shows
16, 8 and 4 bits one after another, a key each.

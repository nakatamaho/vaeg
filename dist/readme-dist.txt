88VA Eternal Grafx Rel.260713 distribution README
================================================

This archive contains the portable SDL2/Dear ImGui build of 88VA
Eternal Grafx. Source archives are attached automatically by GitHub
Releases for the release tag; this archive contains one platform binary
package.

Disk images and guest WAV payloads are not included. ROMs are not
included and must be extracted from hardware you own.

Files supplied by the release package
-------------------------------------

Keep this relative layout after unpacking:

- vaeg or vaeg.exe
- CHANGES.20260713.md
- assets/OFL.txt
- assets/NOTICE.md
- README-dist.txt

The Dear ImGui Japanese font, historical VAEG startup graphic, historical
VAEG application icon, and MIT-licensed suzukiplan Z80 core are embedded in
the executable. OFL.txt and NOTICE.md document their licenses and provenance
and must stay with the package.

Additional platform runtime files:

- Windows: SDL2, LibArchive, compression libraries, and the MinGW GCC,
  libstdc++, and winpthread runtimes are statically linked into vaeg.exe.
  The GUI font, startup image, and application icon are embedded. No
  companion DLL or frontend asset file is required.
- Linux: SDL2 and LibArchive are system dependencies. Install your
  distribution's SDL2 and LibArchive runtime packages. Rel.260713 is built
  and tested on the GitHub Actions ubuntu-latest runner using the
  linux-ci-gcc preset, libsdl2-dev, and libarchive-dev. Frontend assets are
  embedded; no system-wide desktop entry is installed.
- macOS: the release preset statically links pinned FetchContent SDL2,
  LibArchive, and compression libraries. macOS system frameworks remain
  operating-system dependencies. Frontend assets are embedded. This release
  is a plain executable rather than an app bundle, so it has no Finder
  bundle icon.

Files you must supply
---------------------

Place ROMs beside vaeg or vaeg.exe. The model ROM sets are separate:

- VA: vadic.rom, vafont.rom, varom00.rom, varom08.rom, varom1.rom
- VA2/VA3: vadic_va2.rom, vafont_va2.rom, varom00_va2.rom,
  varom08_va2.rom, varom1_va2.rom
- Shared extra FDD subsystem ROM: vasubsys.rom

VA2/VA3 does not fall back to the unsuffixed VA names. The _va2.rom files
have model-specific contents and checksums; do not create them by renaming
or copying the VA ROMs. The frontend warns about size, CRC32, or SHA-1
differences but does not block startup solely for a checksum mismatch.

Supply your own disk images. You can mount floppy images from the GUI or
pass up to two image paths on the command line:

    ./vaeg disk1.d88 disk2.d88

On Windows:

    vaeg.exe disk1.d88 disk2.d88

VA configuration prerequisites
------------------------------

For VA booting, vaeg.cfg must select the VA machine, matching sound
hardware, and the VA clock domain:

    pc_model=88VA1
    SNDboard=100
    clk_base=3993600
    clk_mult=2

SNDboard=100 is the VA built-in YM2203/OPN. Use SNDboard=200 for a VA
with Sound Board II, or with pc_model=88VA2 for YM2608/OPNA. The GUI
selects these defaults when the boot model changes. If you reuse an
existing config, invalid combinations can stop at a V2 screen, leave
sound hardware unbound, or run in the wrong clock domain.

Config and state file locations
-------------------------------

The portable frontend normally stores writable files outside the unpacked
distribution directory:

- Linux: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/vaeg or $HOME/.config/vaeg
- Windows: %APPDATA%\vaeg
- macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/vaeg

vaeg.cfg, vabkupmem.dat, and fixed GUI save-state slots normally live
there. An executable-local vaeg.cfg or existing vabkupmem.dat takes
priority over its user-state counterpart and is saved in place. Save
states and keyboard sidecars remain in the user directory.
Save-state files are tied to the architecture and build family that
created them; do not move them between old Win32 builds, portable
builds, different CPU architectures, or different operating systems.

macOS unsigned binary note
--------------------------

The macOS command-line binary is not code-signed. If Finder or Gatekeeper
adds quarantine metadata after download, remove it from the unpacked
release directory before running:

    xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine vaeg-rel260713-macos-arm64

You can also remove it from just the binary:

    xattr -d com.apple.quarantine ./vaeg

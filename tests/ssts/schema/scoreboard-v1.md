# uPD9002 SST scoreboard schema version 1

All scoreboard, failure-shard, and transition JSON is UTF-8, serialized with
lexicographically sorted object keys, no insignificant whitespace, and one
trailing LF. A digest of a hash set is SHA-256 over the same canonical JSON
serialization of the unique lowercase hashes in lexical order.

`vaeg-upd9002-ssts-scoreboard-v1` identifies one profile and one scope.
`architectural/ci`, `architectural/full`, and `fingerprint/full` are distinct
artifact families. The architectural profile is blocking and uses the
metadata-defined FLAGS mask. The fingerprint profile is diagnostic,
non-blocking, and compares all 16 FLAGS bits. Both exclude cycles, prefetch,
and bus timing.

Each `records` element is an outcome-independent corpus structural form plus
one top-level classification. `opcode` is a lowercase byte. For opcode `0f`,
`subform` is the lowercase second byte with an optional `.0` through `.7`
group suffix. Other grouped opcodes use `.0` through `.7`; ungrouped opcodes
use `-`. `form` is the corresponding uppercase corpus form. Non-applicable
records have zero `executed`, `pass`, and `fail`; they are never presented as
passes. In applicable records, `selected == executed == pass + fail`.
`termination_classes` and `mismatch_classes` count failed records in that
form; the summary-level termination counter covers every executed record.

`vaeg-upd9002-ssts-scoreboard-failures-v1` shards failed records by the first
hex digit of `form`. Entries are ordered by the canonical record SHA-256 and
contain the upstream test SHA-1, failure-signature SHA-256, exact form,
FLAGS mask, mismatch classes, and expected/actual termination. Gzip uses an
empty filename, compression level 9, and `mtime=0`; validation decompresses,
canonicalizes, recompresses, and requires byte identity.

`vaeg-upd9002-ssts-transition-v1` compares the scoreboard with an explicitly
supplied approved predecessor SHA. Hash arrays and classification changes are
ordered by record SHA-256. Changed failure signatures require deterministic
content-addressed shards and human review; the G58 ratchet rejects them.

The executable schema validator and positive/negative tests are in
`tools/qa/upd9002_ssts_ratchet.py`. Unknown fields, versions, classifications,
gap kinds, malformed forms, inconsistent counts, nondeterministic order, and
nondeterministic gzip all fail closed.

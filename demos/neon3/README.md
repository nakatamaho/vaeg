# NEON3 PC-88VA port

This directory is the P3 work tree for the `NEON3286` migration.  The source
under `src/` includes the original NEON3 fixed-point geometry from
`demos/neon3_1_5/98/` without modifying or copying that source.

The current payload is the P3-B geometry/SGP harness.  It reuses the original
PC-98 projection and nine-scene, 6144-frame timeline, while replacing the
original raster backend with VA BIOS mode entry and a bounded VA SGP command
list.  LINE and complete-word CLS records are submitted and waited on once
per logical frame.  Partial 4bpp endpoint read-modify-write and water-raster
CPU pixels are deliberately not part of this increment.

Both logical profiles are built with the same geometry:

```text
./build.sh 200 /absolute/path/neon200.bin
./build.sh 400 /absolute/path/neon400.bin
```

For a bounded local smoke payload, set `NEON_BUILD_FRAME_LIMIT` to a positive
decimal value.  The default remains the original 6144-frame timeline:

```text
NEON_BUILD_FRAME_LIMIT=1 ./build.sh 200 /absolute/path/neon200-one.bin
```

Profile 200 maps logical Y to the 640x200 display window.  Profile 400 keeps
the full 640x400 window.  Both profiles use the same logical scene and SGP
command format; the physical Y mapping and clear-page word count are the only
profile differences.

The files produced by `build.sh` are raw payloads.  For the local bootable
PC-Engine validation disk, wrap each raw payload with
`src/neon_payload_loader.asm` before installing it.  The wrapper copies the
payload to the loader-owned segment and records the validated return
continuation; installing the raw payload directly leaves the loader stub in
control and produces a blank/hung run.  A bootable PC-Engine validation disk
is a local test artifact and is not a repository deliverable.

For example:

```sh
nasm -f bin -O2 \
  -dNEON_PAYLOAD_FILE=\"/absolute/path/NEON200.raw.COM\" \
  -I demos/neon3/src/ demos/neon3/src/neon_payload_loader.asm \
  -o /absolute/path/NEON200.COM
```

## SGP command-list capacity experiment

The default build keeps a 20 KiB command list in the payload segment.  That
layout is intentionally unchanged.  To test whether the late-scene stop is
capacity-related without growing the COM image, an opt-in build places the
list in main RAM segment `2000h` and selects a larger capacity:

```sh
NEON_BUILD_SGP_EXTERNAL_LIST=1 \
NEON_BUILD_SGP_LIST_CAPACITY=24576 \
./build.sh 200 /absolute/path/neon200-external24k.raw
```

The external-list mode is a diagnostic experiment, not a new default hardware
contract.  It must be compared with the default payload using the same D88,
frame limit, and status capture.  A static 24 KiB list in the payload is
rejected by the `E000h` loader-reserve guard instead of silently producing an
oversized payload.  It is incompatible with the optional
`NEON_SAFE_BIOS_STACK` build because that mode also reserves segment `2000h`.

## P3 human gate

The P3 gate disk contains four independent COM programs.  Run them from the
PC-Engine prompt and record the visible result and the status screen.  The
programs use VA BIOS services (INT 8Fh for video, INT 83h for text, and INT
82h for keyboard); they do not use DOS INT 21h services.  The status overlay
clears the main TVRAM rows before composing the status page.  The inherited
system-line row is left to the loader/editor environment; no speculative
system-line service is called from the payload.

* `NEONINI.COM` performs VA V3/G0 initialization only.  Press `ESC` to
  verify the VA BIOS leave path and return to the prompt.
* `NEONSMK.COM` clears G0 and submits a deterministic white rectangle through
  SGP `CLS`/`LINE`.  The rectangle must be visible.  Press `ESC` after the
  idle state is reached.
* `NEON200.COM` runs the complete 640x200-profile timeline (6144 rendered
  frames).  The VA text overlay is cleared with the Text BIOS screen-CLS and
refreshed after each completed frame, showing the global frame, scene title,
and scene-local frame above the moving G0 scene.  The compact overlay omits
diagnostic key rows.  At
  the end it switches to the VA text status screen; `FRAMES` and `LIMIT`
  should both be `1800` (hex), then press `ESC`.
* `NEON400.COM` runs the same complete 6144-frame timeline with the 640x400
  logical profile and the same live text overlay.
For each run, check:

1. the graphics result is visible before the status screen;
2. the status screen is readable and `BIOS` is `0000` (no failure marker);
3. `BIOS RC` is `0000` and `SGP` is `0001` after a completed SGP list;
4. `ESC` returns through the loader without a reset or hang;
5. after returning, the prompt accepts another command.

The VAEG headless capture is only a diagnostic aid.  A black or missing
capture is reported as `UNCONFIRMED`; it is not a human-gate pass.  Real
PC-88VA/VA2 observation is the acceptance criterion for P3.

## Double buffering

`NEON200.COM` and `NEON400.COM` render each SGP command list to the hidden
FB0 page and present it only after SGP completion at a VBLANK boundary.  The
200-line profile exchanges pages at `0xFA00` bytes (SGP bases `0x200000` and
`0x20FA00`); the 400-line profile exchanges pages at `0x1F400` bytes (SGP
bases `0x200000` and `0x21F400`).  FB0 DSA word ports `020Eh/0210h` are used
for the display source.  The 400-line BIOS descriptor remains one 640x400
window; the second physical page is selected through the DSA/SGP offset pair
because the VA BIOS rejects an 800-line descriptor.  These are the same
documented two-page values used by the existing VA SGP wireframe contract.
Real PC-88VA/VA2 timing remains hardware-pending until observed on each
machine.

The SGP command buffer is a bounded per-batch queue.  Dense scenes may emit
more commands than fit in one queue; the backend closes the current batch
with `END`, waits for SGP idle, then starts another batch with `SET_WORK` and
the current colour before continuing the same hidden page.  A command is
reserved as a whole, so neither `LINE` nor `CLS` can be split across batches.
The compiled default frame limit remains `0x1800` (6144); a shorter limit is
available only when explicitly requested through `NEON_BUILD_FRAME_LIMIT` for
diagnostic builds.

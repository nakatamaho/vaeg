# 65536-color double-buffered pseudo-sprite

`SGP655S.COM` is a compact direct-color pseudo-sprite teaching demo. It uses
two 320x200 Graphic 0 pages backed by a 320x400, 16-bpp source surface.
The pages are exchanged by writing the FB0 display-start registers after SGP
has finished rendering the hidden page.

The frame is rebuilt in place with SGP commands:

1. one linear `CLS` of the hidden 320x200 page;
2. moving 24x24 transparent 16-bpp spheres through `BITBLT`; each sphere
   selects one of 16 HSV hue bitmaps;
3. one word-wise FB0 DSA page exchange at the next synchronization point.

There is no G1 page and no CPU pixel loop. The two-page G0 arrangement keeps
the clear and sprite transfer off the displayed page, eliminating the severe
single-page tearing seen in the earlier version. Each hue bitmap uses
supersampled Phong-style diffuse/specular shading while remaining
monochromatic. SPACE toggles a direct-SGP white square grid whose cells are
16x16 logical pixels. UP/DOWN (or `+`/`-`) changes the active sphere count from
one to 128. If SGP misses a field, presentation can repeat an intact page, but
it does not expose partially drawn rows.

The position and velocity table is deterministic. Its logical y values are
selected from 0 through 199, including the lower third, and each record uses
one of sixteen integer velocity directions. The runtime clamps the 24-pixel
top edge to the safe visible range before emitting each BITBLT.

Build:

```sh
NASM=/opt/local/bin/nasm demo/sgp-pseudo-sprite/65536/build.sh /tmp/SGP655S.COM
```

The program uses the same verified direct-color setup as the 65536-color
wireframe track: `GRMODE=0xb462`, `GRRES=0x1313`, `FBW=640`, `FBL=400`, and
`DSH=200`. SGP command and display-start registers are written as words.

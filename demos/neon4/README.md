# NEON RELAY 4 PC-88VA profiles

The NEON4 source under `src/` builds both profiles from one NASM tree.  The
scene geometry and the complete eight-scene, 3072-frame timeline are shared;
both published profiles loop back to scene 0 after the final scene until ESC.
The profile value is selected by `NEON4_P5_PROFILE`:

| Profile | Executable directory | VA mode | Colour representation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `16` | `16/neon4.com` | 640x400, packed 4bpp G0 | 16 indices, each selected from the 4096-colour palette |
| `65536` | `65536/neon4.com` | 320x200, direct 16bpp G0 | native VA direct colour |

## 16-colour palette mode

The 640x400 profile is not RGB332.  Each pixel is a four-bit palette index,
and the sixteen palette entries are 12-bit colours selected from the VA's
4096-colour space.  The word written to `$SetPal` follows the PC-88VA
technical manual layout documented in `docs/tekumani/PC88VA_テクニカルマニュアル_BNN.md`:

```text
G[3:0] -> bits 15..12
R[3:0] -> bits 9..6
B[3:0] -> bits 4..1
```

The source table is stored as G/R/B nibbles in `src/low4_data.inc`; the VA
backend converts those nibbles at startup through BIOS `INT 8Fh`, `$PalCtl`
(`AX=0900h`), and `$SetPal` (`AX=0800h`, `AL=index`, `CX=value`).  Graphics
composition is then selected with `$Compose` G0-only (`AX=0300h`,
`CX=0003h`).  No RGB332 conversion or per-frame palette animation is used by
this profile.

The 4bpp framebuffer uses the validated FB0 layout: a 640x400 page is 128,000
bytes (`320` bytes per row), two pages occupy the 256 KiB single-plane GVRAM
window, and the second page begins at SGP address `21F400h` / DSA offset
`01F400h`.  The `$DefBuf` pixel-size (`DOT`) field is `4`, meaning packed
four-bit pixels; it is not a direct-colour value.  Logical scene coordinates
are already 640x400, so this profile does not halve X or Y at the primitive
boundary.

## Build

Build either raw loader payload directly:

```sh
NEON4_P5_PROFILE=16 ./build_p5.sh /absolute/path/neon4-16.com
NEON4_P5_PROFILE=65536 ./build_p5.sh /absolute/path/neon4-65536.com
```

`build_p5.sh` wraps the stage-8 payload with the validated VA loader return
continuation.  `NEON4_P5_PROFILE=16` is the 640x400 palette build; the numeric
name is a profile identifier, not a 16bpp mode.

## D88 images

`build-d88.sh` creates one non-bootable distribution data disk containing only
the two freely distributable payloads:

```text
A:\16\neon4.com
A:\65536\neon4.com
```

It also writes the compressed companion (`OUTPUT.d88.xz`).  The only generated
binary allowed to be tracked under this directory is the reproducible
`neon4-distribution.d88.xz` image; raw D88 images and bootable validation
disks remain local artifacts outside Git.  The source 2HD template is used
only for geometry and is never modified.

```sh
./build-d88.sh /path/to/pcengine110-bootonly.d88 \
    /absolute/path/neon4-distribution.d88
```

For local VAEG or real-machine validation, use the bootable builder.  It keeps
the PC-Engine system files from the supplied local template and installs the
same two payload directories:

```sh
./build-bootable-d88.sh /path/to/pcengine110-bootonly.d88 \
    /private/tmp/neon4-bootable.d88
```

The bootable image is deliberately not a repository artifact.

## Verification boundary

The 16-colour mode setup and palette writes are exercised by the existing SGP
VAEG path.  The palette word layout is derived from the Tekumani BNN manual
and the VAEG `adjustcolor12()` implementation.  Final acceptance on PC-88VA
hardware remains a separate hardware gate; VAEG functional output does not
claim silicon timing or colour-converter equivalence.

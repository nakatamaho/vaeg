# CP/MVA setup guide

This guide explains how to prepare and run CP/MVA on VAEG. The procedure was
validated with the M76 uPD70008-compatible Z80 emulation path and a generated
CP/M tools disk that reaches the CP/M `A>` prompt.

## Requirements

- A VAEG build with the M76 changes.
- A user-owned, FAT-formatted PC-Engine boot D88. The input image must be
  obtained lawfully; VAEG does not redistribute PC-Engine ROMs or guest disks.
- Python 3.10 or newer.
- `z80asm` 1.8. If none is supplied with `--assembler` or `VAEG_Z80ASM` and
  none is in `PATH`, the installer downloads the locked z80asm 1.8 source,
  verifies its SHA-256, and builds it once into its cache. This needs a C
  compiler (`cc`, `gcc`, `clang`, or `$CC`).
- `lha` (lha-1.14i or lhasa, e.g. the Debian/Ubuntu `lhasa` package) or
  `unar` for the CPMVA archive.

The installer downloads and verifies the locked CPMVA, CP/M, game, and BDS C
sources. It does not execute downloaded DOS or CP/M programs on the host.

## Build the disks

From the VAEG checkout, run:

```sh
python3 tools/cpmva/install_cpmva.py \
    --boot-disk /path/to/pcengine-boot.d88 \
    --output-dir /path/to/cpmva-ready \
    --accept-cpm-license \
    --accept-cpmva-license \
    --accept-games-license \
    --accept-bdsc-license
```

The original boot disk is never modified. The output directory contains:

```text
pcengine-boot-cpmva.d88  PC-Engine boot disk copy with CPMVA files
cpmva-tools.d88         CP/M tools and games disk
cpmva-source.d88        source and documentation disk
cpmva-dev.d88           BDS C development disk
cpmva-zexall-test.d88   Z80 exercisers and uPD9002 flag probes only
cpmva-zexall-test.2d.d88  the same disk with the 2D (00h) media byte
cpmva-build-manifest.json
cpmva-install-report.txt
```

The installer builds the 64K CP/M 2.2 CCP/BDOS from the locked public source,
combines it with the CPMVA `CPMBIOS.COM`, and writes the resulting `CPM.SYS`.
It does not use NEC `MOVCPM5.COM`, `DDT.COM`, `SAVE`, M80, L80, or MASM.

For an offline installation, populate the cache during an online run and add
`--offline`. Local archives can be supplied with `--cpmva-archive`,
`--cpm22-archive`, `--vt100-games-archive`, and `--bdsc-archive`; every local
archive is still checked against the lock file. See
[`tools/cpmva/README.md`](../tools/cpmva/README.md) for source-lock and cache
details.

For automated runs, `--screen-dump PATH` saves the final rendered SDL screen as a BMP.
Use `--screen-tvram-dump PATH` separately when the raw `VAEGSCN1` TVRAM diagnostic is
needed; omitting both options preserves the normal display defaults.

## Run CP/MVA in VAEG

1. Start VAEG and load `pcengine-boot-cpmva.d88` as the PC-Engine floppy
   boot disk.
2. Boot the guest and run `CPMVA.BAT`, or type `CPMVA` at the DOS prompt.
3. When CP/MVA displays `Set CP/M diskette on drive FD1: and hit any key`,
   replace FD1 with `cpmva-tools.d88`.
4. Press a key. CP/MVA loads the CCP, BDOS, and BIOS from the tools disk and
   should display the CP/M `A>` prompt.
5. Run `DIR` to verify the tools disk, then run `EXIT` to return to
   PC-Engine.
6. Swap FD1 to `cpmva-source.d88` or `cpmva-dev.d88` when source files or BDS C
   tools are needed.

The CP/MVA disk images generated together by the installer must be used as a
set. Do not manually rewrap them as another D88 geometry; the tested VAEG
layout preserves the CP/M directory and sector mapping expected by the
PC-88VA BIOS.
The CP/MVA `CPMBIOS.MAC` DPB uses `EXM=1`, so the installer stores two
16 KiB sub-extents in one directory entry. Large programs such as
`BACKGMMN.COM` and `CC2.COM` must not be manually split into one entry per
16 KiB; that legacy layout repeats the same logical extent and causes CP/MVA
to load only the first part of the program. The installer validator rejects
duplicate or gapped logical extents before emitting a disk.

## Headless runs

The SDL2 frontend accepts the existing headless input script format. A disk
can be swapped after CP/MVA has displayed its prompt with `@fdd1`:

```text
CPMVA
@wait 1200
@fdd1 /path/to/cpmva-tools.d88
@wait 1200
@enter
@wait 600
DIR
@wait 600
EXIT
```

Pass the script with `--headless-input-script /path/to/script.txt`. This is
useful for repeatable smoke tests, but it does not replace the interactive
instruction to change FD1 in a normal session.

## Z80 exercisers and uPD9002 flag probes

The installer also assembles the following CP/M programs with z80asm 1.8 and
puts them on both `cpmva-tools.d88` and `cpmva-zexall-test.d88` (M101). They exist
only on the disks you generate; VAEG does not distribute them.

| Program | Output | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ZEXDOC.COM`, `ZEXALL.COM` | console | Stock exercisers, rebuilt byte-identically from `external/zex` |
| `ZEXDOCF.COM`, `ZEXALLF.COM` | `ZEXDOC.TXT`, `ZEXALL.TXT` | Stock exercisers that also write the console output to a file |
| `ZEX13S.COM` | `ZEX13S.TXT` | ZEXDOC with `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` split into single-opcode groups |
| `FLAGPRB.COM` | `FLAGPRB.TXT` | Direct flag probes P0–P7 for rules R1–R7 |
| `DAADUMP.COM` | `DAA.BIN`, `CPL.BIN`, `SCF.BIN`, `CCF.BIN`, `DAADUMP.TXT` | Exhaustive DAA/CPL/SCF/CCF dump |
| `ZEXIY.COM` | `ZEXIY.TXT` | INC/DEC IXH/IXL/IYH/IYL, correcting the stock ZEX iyh/iyl groups (M102) |
| `ZEXUND.COM` | `ZEXUND.TXT` | Undocumented DDCB/FDCB forms, NEG duplicates and redundant DD/FD prefixes (M102) |
| `ZEXED.COM` | `ZEXED.TXT` | Undefined ED opcodes, expected to be NOPs (M102); run last |
| `EDPRB.COM` | `EDxx.TXT` | One-by-one probe of undefined ED opcodes and the NEG/RETN duplicates (M102) |
| `CBPRB.COM` | `CBPRB.TXT` | One-by-one probe of every DD/FD CB opcode with two input sets (M102) |
| `EDPRB2.COM` | `E2xx.TXT` | Second ED probe: sandboxed pointers, instruction length, three input sets (M102) |
| `EDPRB2S.COM` | `S2xx.TXT` | `EDPRB2` for nine opcodes with the code moved by 100h bytes (M102) |
| `INPRB.COM` | `INPRB.TXT` | Documented `IN` reads of the ports named by C in the ED probes (M102); real machine only, the host runner rejects I/O |

`EDPRB` prints `ED xx` before each opcode and closes its output file after
every record, so a run that hangs keeps all earlier results. After a reset,
continue with the next opcode, for example `EDPRB A5`; that run writes
`EDA5.TXT`, and `compare.py` merges all `ED??.TXT` files.

`EDPRB2` (generated by `tools/cpmva/zex/edprb2.py`) prints `ED xx s` before
each run, where `s` is the input set 0–2, and also closes its file after every
256-byte record. Restart it in the same way, for example `EDPRB2 C1` writes
`E2C1.TXT`. By default it skips the opcodes that left the CP/M emulation mode
on the real machine (ED 54, 55, AC and EE–FC); add `+` to run them as well,
for example `EDPRB2 EE+`. `EDPRB2S` runs nine opcodes in a shifted layout and
writes `S200.TXT`. Both need about 140 KiB of free space together, so run them
on a freshly generated `cpmva-zexall-test.d88`.

The ZEX-derived programs are GPL-2.0-or-later; see
`external/zex/provenance.txt` and ADR-0015. Output files are written to the
current CP/M drive. `DAADUMP` needs about 130 KiB of free space, which the
tools disk does not have. For real-machine runs, write `cpmva-zexall-test.2d.d88` to the medium: it
differs from `cpmva-zexall-test.d88` only in the media byte at offset 1Bh
(00h instead of the 10h that vaeg needs; see the `wrap_cpm_d88` comment),
which real-disk writing tools expect for the 2D-320 geometry. In vaeg, swap
FD1 to `cpmva-zexall-test.d88`
after CP/M has started, press Ctrl-C to log in the new disk, and run the
programs from it; it holds only these programs and has room for all of their
outputs. The ZEX runs take hours on a real PC-88VA.

To produce host references and compare real-machine outputs:

```sh
cmake --build --preset linux-ci-gcc --target vaeg_cpm_runner
python3 tools/cpmva/zex/host_reference.py \
    --runner build/linux-ci-gcc/vaeg_cpm_runner --output /tmp/m101-host
python3 tools/cpmva/zex/compare.py /path/to/real-outputs --ref /tmp/m101-host/ref
```

`host_reference.py` writes `programs/MANIFEST.TXT` with the SHA-256 of every
program and checks the host acceptance criteria for the Zilog and uPD9002
profiles; `--skip-zex` omits the long ZEXDOCF/ZEXALLF runs. It obtains
z80asm 1.8 the same way as the installer.

## Troubleshooting

- If CP/M stops before `A>`, confirm that the boot disk is the generated
  `pcengine-boot-cpmva.d88` and that FD1 was changed to the matching
  `cpmva-tools.d88` only after the CP/MVA disk prompt.
- If `DIR` reports `Bdos Err on A: Bad Sector` or shows no file names,
  regenerate the disks with the same installer version and use the generated
  pair without a manual D88 conversion.
- If `EXIT` is reported as unknown, verify that `EXIT.COM` is visible in
  `DIR` and that the tools disk is still mounted in FD1.
- Existing output files require `--force`; `--dry-run` and `--verify-only`
  do not replace output files.

CP/M, CPMVA, the included games, BDS C, and their documentation retain their
original licenses. The installer records their provenance and does not assign
VAEG's BSD-2-Clause license to those materials or to generated disk images.

# PC-88VA Network Adapter Research

This note records the available evidence for using Ethernet adapters with the
PC-88VA family and outlines a possible vaeg implementation. It is a research
note, not a statement that vaeg currently emulates a network adapter.

## Conclusion

No evidence found in this investigation identifies a built-in or dedicated NEC
PC-88VA Ethernet adapter. The demonstrated approach is to install a PC-98 C-Bus
Ethernet adapter in a PC-88VA expansion slot and use a packet driver patched for
the VA environment.

The two adapter families found in PC-88VA reports are:

| Adapter | Hardware role | PC-88VA evidence |
|---|---|---|
| ICM IF-2771ET | Combined SCSI and Ethernet adapter | A VA3 experiment used a VA-patched `IF27PDVA.COM` packet driver and assigned Ethernet to INT2. |
| MELCO/Buffalo LGY-98J-T | Ethernet adapter | A VA2 report identifies a PC-98 driver and a corresponding VA patch. |

Buffalo describes the
[LGY-98J-T](https://www.buffalo.jp/product/detail/lgy-98j-t.html) as a LAN
adapter for PC-98 and EPSON desktop systems. NEC's
[PC-88VA2 specification](https://support.nec-lavie.jp/support/product/data/spec/cpu/b048-1.html)
documents the expansion slots but does not list Ethernet as a standard device.

## Reported PC-88VA Configuration

The [Asayan PC-88VA3 report](https://www.asayan-town.com/nec/pc-88va3/)
describes an ICM IF-2771ET installation with the following resource plan:

| Resource | Assignment in the report |
|---|---|
| Ethernet interrupt | INT2 |
| Ethernet I/O | Adapter default; the exact value is not stated on the page |
| SCSI I/O | `0CCxh` |
| SCSI interrupt | INT0 |
| Internal VA3 2TD interrupt | INT1 |
| Standard FDD DMA | DMA2 |
| 2TD DMA | DMA3 |

The report generated `IF27PDVA.COM` by placing the PC-98 packet driver and
`vapatch.com` together. Its software stack included `PCPAT.SYS`, `MSE312.SYS`,
`IF27PDVA.COM`, and TEENE. The route configuration appeared plausible, but the
author reported unresolved broadcast behavior. It therefore demonstrates
hardware and driver bring-up, not a completely verified network session.

Additional VA2 reports indexed under the
[PC-88VA article tag](https://blogtag.ameba.jp/news/PC-88VA) mention both the
ICM IF-2771ET and MELCO LGY-98J-T, VA patches for their PC-98 drivers, and
experiments with TEEN/TEENE. These are individual experimental reports rather
than manufacturer specifications and should be treated accordingly.

## DOS Software Path

The expected guest software stack is:

```text
PC-98 C-Bus Ethernet adapter
  -> VA-patched DOS packet driver
    -> DOS packet-driver interface
      -> TEENE or another packet-driver TCP/IP stack
        -> guest network applications
```

TEENE expects a packet driver to be loaded first. A general
[PC-98 DOS networking overview](https://www.watakatsu.com/dos/dosterm.html)
describes this packet-driver-to-TEENE sequence. A modern
[PC-98 TEEN setup example](https://asanobuturi.github.io/document/2023/10/)
shows an LGY packet driver followed by TEENE, but its PC-98 command-line values
must not be assumed to be valid for the VA-patched driver.

The exact VA packet-driver command line, software interrupt vector, patch
behavior, and redistribution license remain unverified. Driver binaries must
not be added to the repository without a separate provenance and license
review.

## Adapter Hardware Model

Both reported families are NE2000/DP8390-class adapters with PC-98 C-Bus port
layouts. They must not be modeled as a PC/AT NE2000 at a conventional linear
I/O base.

A historical
[Linux/98 NE2000 C-Bus patch](https://www.cs.helsinki.fi/linux/linux-kernel/2003-11/1295.html)
classifies MELCO LGY-98 adapters as hardware type 4 and ICM IF-2766ET/
IF-2771ET adapters as type 5. It provides the following implementation-level
port mappings:

| Family | Register base | Remote-DMA data port | Reset/probe area |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| ICM IF-27xxET | `56D0h` | base + `100h` | base + `10Fh` |
| MELCO LGY-98 | selectable `00D0h` through `70D0h` | base + `200h` | base + `300h` area |

The [FreeBSD PC-98 hardware notes](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/5.0R/hardware-pc98/)
independently list LGY-98 as type 4 and IF-2766ET/IF-2771ET as type 5 DS8390
adapters.

The [Neko Project 21/W LGY-98 analysis](https://simk98.github.io/np21w/docs/lgy98.html)
documents the non-linear port layout, selectable INT0/INT1/INT2/INT5 interrupt
lines, adapter-specific probe registers, and the remote-DMA-complete behavior
expected by the DOS driver. Its
[download page](https://simk98.github.io/np21w/download.html) identifies the
current `lgy98*.*` implementation as MIT-licensed. Any future reuse still
requires an exact version, source-header, and provenance audit before code is
imported.

## Current vaeg State

The active CMake/SDL2 tree has no Ethernet adapter or host network backend.
There is no DP8390/NE2000 device, packet RAM, pcap/TAP adapter, or user-mode NAT
backend in the active source list.

`generic/hostdrv.c` contains an old comment referring to a network interface,
but `hostdrv` is a DOS host-shared-drive service reached through the NP2 system
port. It is not Ethernet emulation and cannot satisfy a DOS packet driver.

The existing infrastructure that could host a future adapter is:

- `cbus/cbuscore.c`: C-Bus device reset and bind boundary.
- `io/iocore.c` and `io/iocore.h`: full 16-bit I/O handler attachment.
- `io/pic.c` and `io/pic.h`: interrupt assertion and the existing `IRQ_INT2`
  mapping.

No current configuration or GUI entry should imply that networking is
available.

## Recommended Implementation Boundary

The first implementation should emulate one verified adapter rather than a
generic label named only "network card." ICM IF-2771ET Ethernet is the closest
match to the documented VA3 `IF27PDVA.COM` path. LGY-98 is also a viable first
target if a known-good VA-patched LGY packet driver can be verified.

The implementation can be separated into these layers:

1. A C DP8390/NE2000 core implementing register pages, packet RAM, ring-buffer
   receive, transmit, remote DMA, ISR/IMR behavior, and reset.
2. A thin C-Bus adapter implementing the selected card's non-linear I/O map,
   board-specific probe behavior, MAC address storage, and reset semantics.
3. VA interrupt routing, initially fixed to INT2 where that matches the tested
   guest configuration.
4. A host packet backend behind a narrow interface so guest hardware does not
   depend directly on SDL2 or a host networking library.
5. SDL2 configuration and GUI controls for adapter enablement, backend, and MAC
   address only after the hardware path passes ROM-less tests.

For IF-2771ET, the first scope should emulate only its Ethernet function. The
combined card's SCSI function should remain separate from vaeg's existing
SASI/SCSI path until its coupling and resource conflicts are understood.

A user-mode NAT backend such as libslirp is the preferred initial host backend:
it is portable and does not require privileged TAP setup. Raw TAP or pcap
bridging can be a later, explicit option for LAN broadcast and non-IP traffic.
The dependency, exact version, license, static-link implications, and platform
availability require an ADR before adoption.

## Verification Plan

ROM-less tests should cover:

- DP8390 reset values and register-page selection.
- Remote DMA read/write and packet-memory ring wrap.
- Transmit completion, receive insertion, ISR/IMR behavior, and IRQ release.
- Exact ICM or LGY non-linear I/O address translation.
- INT2 assertion and deassertion through the existing PIC.
- Device reset, disabled-card behavior, and persistent MAC parsing.
- Host-backend packet length and bounds validation.

The human gate should use a legally obtained, known-good VA packet driver and
test at least:

- packet-driver probe and initialization;
- TEENE startup;
- communication with the user-mode gateway;
- DNS plus one simple TCP operation such as FTP or Telnet;
- VA2 and VA3 resource configurations;
- VA3 operation without conflicting with the internal 2TD interrupt;
- no regression with the adapter disabled.

## Open Questions

- Which adapter and VA-patched packet-driver version will be the compatibility
  target?
- What are the exact packet-driver invocation, software interrupt, and expected
  probe sequence?
- Is the reported IF-2771ET broadcast failure a driver issue, adapter resource
  issue, TEENE configuration issue, or a limitation of that experiment?
- Does every VA model decode all adapter-specific C-Bus registers identically?
- Which packet-driver and patch sources can be legally retained for automated
  or human testing?
- Is user-mode NAT sufficient, or is raw Ethernet required by the target guest
  software?

Until these questions are resolved, network support should remain a documented
future feature rather than an enabled but approximate device.

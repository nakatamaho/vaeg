# VA ROM Dump Notes and Reference Checks

This document records the current author-confirmed ROM identities and the
VA1-specific read uncertainty observed while dumping `varom00.rom`. It does
not distribute ROM data.

## Current dumps confirmed by the author

These are the current author-confirmed ROM dumps. VA1 uses the unsuffixed
filenames; VA2/VA3 uses the `_va2` filenames. `vasubsys_va2.rom` is listed
separately because it is the VA2/VA3-named copy of the extra subsystem ROM.

| Model | ROM filename | SHA-1 |
|---|---|---|
| VA1 | `vadic.rom` | `5ba1f3578d0aaacdaf7194a80e6d520c81ae55fb` |
| VA2/VA3 | `vadic_va2.rom` | `3665db538598abb45d9dfe636423e6728a812b12` |
| VA1 | `vafont.rom` | `a0227d1fbc2da5db4b46d8d2c7e7a9ac2d91379f` |
| VA2/VA3 | `vafont_va2.rom` | `a0227d1fbc2da5db4b46d8d2c7e7a9ac2d91379f` |
| VA1 | `varom00.rom` | `e7fc344b12ab0573a5229c7b43feb64bd329e57b` |
| VA2/VA3 | `varom00_va2.rom` | `bcaea28c58816602ca1e8290f534360f1ca03fe8` |
| VA1 | `varom08.rom` | `7e6591cd465cbb35d6d3446c5a83b46d30fafe95` |
| VA2/VA3 | `varom08_va2.rom` | `47e5f89f8b0ce18ff8d5d7b7aef8ca0a2a8e3345` |
| VA1 | `varom1.rom` | `54536dc03238b4668c8bb76337efade001ec7826` |
| VA2/VA3 | `varom1_va2.rom` | `dd4f4521bfbb068f15ab3bcdb8d47c7d82b9d1d4` |
| VA1 | `vasubsys.rom` | `a9375aa480f85e1422a0e1385acb0ea170c5c2e0` |
| VA2/VA3 | `vasubsys_va2.rom` | `a9375aa480f85e1422a0e1385acb0ea170c5c2e0` |

The VA and VA2/VA3 ROM sets are not interchangeable. Do not create a
`*_va2.rom` dump by renaming an unsuffixed file.

## Dumping source and handling

ROMs must be dumped from hardware owned by the operator. Tools such as
`getromva` are available in `VAEGTOOL070422.LZH` from the
[project-vaeg r080406 release](https://github.com/project-vaeg/vaeg/releases/tag/r080406).
The dump should be kept as a separate source artifact, hashed before any
normalization, and compared with the identities above. Keep ROM bytes and
private dump files outside the public source tree.

## Uncertainty of `varom00.rom` (VA1 only; not applicable to VA2/VA3)

This section applies only to the unsuffixed VA1 `varom00.rom`. It does not
apply to `varom00_va2.rom` or to the VA2/VA3 ROM set.

### Sample identity

The original dated private dump names are intentionally normalized to neutral
sample labels. The comparison glob excluded `docs/roms/varom00.rom`, which is
the selected working copy of `sample3`.

| Sample | SHA-1 |
|---|---|
| `sample1` | `732cd6b78762466036e608082fabc03df3f869e2` |
| `sample2` | `2595bab29556d4efebb6608d70b31fb651eb7789` |
| `sample3` | `e7fc344b12ab0573a5229c7b43feb64bd329e57b` |
| MAME-derived reference | `1266ba969959ff25433ecc900a2caced26ef1a9e` |

The MAME-derived reference is recorded by SHA-1 only. No CRC, byte values,
byte-level comparison, or difference locations for that reference are
recorded here.

### Majority result and working reference (VA1 only; not applicable to VA2/VA3)

For the three author read samples, `sample3`
(`e7fc344b12ab0573a5229c7b43feb64bd329e57b`) is the selected majority-result
SHA-1 and current working reference. At every observed read-to-read
difference, the `sample3` byte agrees with one of the other two samples. This
is a reproducibility choice, not proof of a perfect electrical capture.

The selected `sample3` image is 512 KiB with CRC-32 `df7f8a74` and the SHA-1
shown above. These are the full-image values used by the current VA1 ROM-set
check. The selected working reference does not match the MAME-derived
reference by SHA-1.

### Populated-bank reference (VA1 only)

`varom00.rom` is a 512 KiB ROM0 image divided into eight 64 KiB banks. The
selected per-bank SHA-1 values for populated banks 0 through 5 are:

| ROM0 bank | SHA-1 |
|---:|---|
| 0 | `35d37a6a1ecf70025a9d1f9a892f3a4d1f6e1d62` |
| 1 | `da5eaedcf34259a406946984e23e80c3fbf9d1a1` |
| 2 | `e3e3ed4a7e0241dcd669b07c2d7b29a4c94744c2` |
| 3 | `67fc27525e2ced658925289b3736002320f3dcdd` |
| 4 | `463e586b9911bc6fc35f79f0a0bd3a43414460a0` |
| 5 | `1d225f958bdc4719e83873d2a66515622d6b2dc0` |

For reference, the combined SHA-1 of banks 0 through 5 (`0x00000` through
`0x5FFFF`) is
`24a7a5091846ec1f177c97711e4837573bc40b42`.

### Observed read-to-read differences (VA1 only)

`sample1` and `sample2` differ at eight byte positions. The eight positions
below are the union of the two reported four-position comparisons with
`sample3`; the original byte values are not recorded here.

| Pair | Difference count | File offsets and ROM0 bank-local offsets |
|---|---:|---|
| `sample1` vs `sample2` | 8 bytes | bank 6: `0x6448`, `0x6BF2`, `0x852F`, `0xA9F5`, `0xD976`; bank 7: `0x7344`, `0x7AF6`, `0xB18E` |
| `sample1` vs `sample3` | 4 bytes | file `0x66BF2` (bank 6 + `0x6BF2`), `0x6852F` (bank 6 + `0x852F`), `0x6A9F5` (bank 6 + `0xA9F5`), `0x77AF6` (bank 7 + `0x7AF6`) |
| `sample2` vs `sample3` | 4 bytes | file `0x66448` (bank 6 + `0x6448`), `0x6D976` (bank 6 + `0xD976`), `0x77344` (bank 7 + `0x7344`), `0x7B18E` (bank 7 + `0xB18E`) |

All reported read-to-read differences are in banks 6 and 7. The bank number
is the file offset divided by `0x10000`.

### Interpretation and VAEG check behavior

The PC-88VA technical manual's ROM area 0 selector table assigns selectors 0
through 5 to `ROM00` through `ROM05`, and marks selectors 6 and 7 as reserved:
[PC-88VA technical manual ROM area 0 table](../tekumani/PC88VA_テクニカルマニュアル_BNN.md:10869).

The observed read-to-read variation is therefore consistent with changes in
the positions documented as reserved. For this VA1 capture set, banks 6 and 7
are not required to match when the populated banks 0 through 5 match. This
does not prove that every timing-dependent variation is harmless or establish
the electrical or sampling mechanism.

When VA1 is selected, VAEG first checks the full `varom00.rom` SHA-1. If it
differs from the selected working reference, VAEG calculates the SHA-1 of
banks 0 through 5, reports the differing populated banks, and points back to
this document. VA2/VA3 does not use this VA1-specific uncertainty rule.

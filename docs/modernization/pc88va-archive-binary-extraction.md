This note records which runnable 16-bit files are unpacked from the
development-media archives.  The archive bytes remain available in the
supplemental Softlib disk; extraction only adds a directly runnable copy.

## Development FDD and SASI HDD

`tools/pc88va/build-utility-disk.sh` now unpacks these packages into the
development payload:

| source archive | installed files |
| --- | --- |
| `EMACSVA.LZH` | `A:\BIN\EMACS.EXE` and its help/config files under `A:\DOC` |
| `CPMVA.LZH` | `A:\BIN\CPMBIOS.COM`, `CPMVA.EXE`, `DO.COM`, `EXIT.COM`, `FCONV.COM`, `RDCPM.EXE` |
| `TDC10.LZH` | `A:\BIN\TDC.COM` |
| `BENCH003.LZH` | `A:\BIN\BENCH.EXE` |

The executable files are passed through the existing DIET step.  The payload
D88 is the source for `build-sasi-development-disks.sh`, so both the VA and
VA2 40 MB SASI images receive the same extracted files.  The SASI builder's
LSI-C and CP/M integrations remain unchanged.

The existing development-disk archives are either source-only, already
expanded by the builder (`JFPPAT`, `2HCDRV`, `ISHARC`, and `TFD`), or are
self-extracting scene packages whose full expansion does not fit the fixed
floppy payload.  No archive-only executable in that payload is silently
omitted by this change.

## Supplemental Softlib FDD

`tools/pc88va/build-softlib-archive-disk.sh` also extracts the runnable files
that were previously present only inside its retained archives:

```text
A:\BIN\EMACS.EXE       A:\BIN\CPMBIOS.COM    A:\BIN\CPMVA.EXE
A:\BIN\DO.COM          A:\BIN\EXIT.COM      A:\BIN\FCONV.COM
A:\BIN\RDCPM.EXE       A:\BIN\TDC.COM       A:\BIN\BENCH.EXE
A:\BIN\2HCDRV.COM      A:\BIN\FDFORM.COM    A:\BIN\VBUFF.COM
A:\BIN\PLUSTAKE.EXE    A:\SYS\JFPPAT.SYS    A:\SYS\RDPCM.SYS
```

`PLUSTAKE.EXE` is the DOS 8.3 name for the `plustakerva.exe` member in
`PRJVA.ZIP`.  The 32-bit Info-ZIP variants and the complete LSI-C tree are not
duplicated on this floppy: the former require a DOS extender and the latter
exceeds the fixed FAT12 free space.  The original archives remain available
under `A:\ARCHIVE`; the complete LSI-C tree is installed on the SASI HDD by
the separate `--lsic-archive` path.

## Reproducibility

Both builders fetch or validate their pinned source archives by SHA-256 and
write generated images outside the repository.  A generated raw D88 is a
private build artifact; only the source scripts and this inventory are
tracked.

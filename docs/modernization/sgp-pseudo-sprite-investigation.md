# PC-88VA SGP Pseudo-Sprite Investigation

>
> **Date:** 2026-08-14 (JST)

## Result

The proposed architecture is valid for the documented PC-88VA programming
model and for the current VAEG implementation:

- single-plane, two-screen mode divides the 256 KiB GVRAM into a 128 KiB
  Graphic 0 region and a 128 KiB Graphic 1 region;
- a packed 320x200x4-bpp surface occupies 32,000 bytes (`0x7d00`);
- two such surfaces occupy 64,000 bytes and fit in Graphic 1;
- `0x7d00` is both four-byte aligned and a multiple of the Graphic 1 BIOS
  display-start granularity of 128 bytes;
- framebuffer 1 has a writable 18-bit display start address (`DSA1`), so the
  two Graphic 1 surfaces can be selected without copying them; and
- VAEG exposes vertical blank at TSP status port `0142h`, bit 6, and samples
  framebuffer state when the next display interval begins.

No fallback architecture is required by the inventory. This is a static
conclusion only. Real guest execution, image comparison, and flicker/tearing
observation remain gates for later milestones.

## Evidence policy

This report distinguishes three kinds of evidence:

- **Documented:** the repository-local PC-88VA Users Club technical text,
  consulted read-only, and the reconstructions linked below;
- **Implemented:** behavior traced in the active VAEG source at the evaluated
  commit; and
- **Proposed:** exact choices for the later NASM demo that have not yet been
  exercised in a guest.

The Users Club material is stronger evidence for hardware fields and
restrictions. VAEG source is used to establish what the emulator currently
does, not to invent hardware behavior.

## 1. Existing graphics-related files

The relevant tracked files are:

- [`pc88va-video-modes.md`](pc88va-video-modes.md): `GRMODE`, `GRRES`,
  framebuffer descriptors, pitch, and the 320x200 field relationship;
- [`upd72022-tsp.md`](upd72022-tsp.md): TSP timing and `0142h` status;
- [`videova.c`](../../io/videova.c): graphics registers, composition,
  transparency masks, palettes, and framebuffer I/O handlers;
- [`makegrphva.c`](../../vram/makegrphva.c): G0/G1 address selection and
  raster fetch; and
- [`scrndrawva.c`](../../vram/scrndrawva.c): priority composition and
  transparent-color rejection.

[`gvramva.c`](../../memoryva/gvramva.c) owns `grphmem[0x40000]`, a 256 KiB
GVRAM image. [`memctrlva.c`](../../io/memctrlva.c) implements port `0153h`:
bit 4 selects single-plane graphics and bank 4 maps GVRAM into the CPU system
memory window. [`memoryva.c`](../../memoryva/memoryva.c) places that window at
CPU physical address `A0000h`.

## 2. Existing SGP implementation files

[`sgp.c`](../../io/sgp.c) and [`sgp.h`](../../io/sgp.h) implement the SGP
command engine, 22-bit address dispatch, commands, busy state, and timing.
[`upd92017-sgp.md`](upd92017-sgp.md) is the repository's reconstructed SGP
specification and records remaining implementation uncertainties.

The VAEG SGP maps `200000h-23ffffh` to `grphmem`, decodes `END`, `NOP`,
`SET_WORK`, `SET_SOURCE`, `SET_DESTINATION`, `SET_COLOR`, `BITBLT`, `PATBLT`,
`LINE`, `CLS`, and the two scan opcodes, and executes only while single-plane
mode is active. The scan commands remain unimplemented; they are not needed
by this demo.

## 3. Existing graphics demos and NASM conventions

No tracked PC-88VA guest graphics or SGP demo source was found. The historical
Users Club BIOS text contains graphics-mode, buffer-definition, composition,
PUT/BITBLT, and page-exchange examples, but not this layered SGP demo.

The existing NASM `.COM` examples are
[`rep0f_probe.asm`](../../tools/hardware/pc88va_rep0f/rep0f_probe.asm) and
[`r2fprobe.asm`](../../tools/pc88va/hostfs/r2fprobe.asm). They use English
source, the repository's 2-clause BSD header, `bits 16`, and `org 0x100`.
The top-level [`CMakeLists.txt`](../../CMakeLists.txt) discovers `nasm`, writes
guest artifacts below the build directory's `guest/` subdirectory, and uses
custom targets. The demo should follow that convention rather than write a
binary into the source tree.

The existing disposable-media workflow is
[`pcengine_disk.py`](../../tools/pc88va/pcengine_disk.py): create a copy from a
user-supplied source D88 and install the generated guest file into that copy.
The source image must never be modified.

## 4. GVRAM layout and the two-page hypothesis

The documented single-plane two-screen layout and VAEG's `addr18()` setup
agree:

| Owner | CPU address with GVRAM bank selected | SGP address | Size |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Graphic 0 | `a0000h-bffffh` | `200000h-21ffffh` | 128 KiB |
| Graphic 1 | `c0000h-dffffh` | `220000h-23ffffh` | 128 KiB |

For 320x200x4 bpp:

~~~text
bytes per line = 320 * 4 / 8 = 160 = 0x00a0
bytes per page = 160 * 200   = 32000 = 0x7d00
two pages                         64000 = 0xfa00
~~~

The proposed exact allocation is:

| Use | CPU address | SGP address | End address | Size |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| G0 background | `a0000h` | `200000h` | `207cffh` | `0x7d00` |
| G1 sprite page A | `c0000h` | `220000h` | `227cffh` | `0x7d00` |
| G1 sprite page B | `c7d00h` | `227d00h` | `22f9ffh` | `0x7d00` |
| unused G1 workspace | `cfa00h` | `22fa00h` | `23ffffh` | `0x10600` |

Framebuffer addresses are stored as `CPU address - A0000h`. Consequently,
the values proposed for framebuffer 1's `DSA` are `20000h` for page A and
`27d00h` for page B. These are full 18-bit register values, not offsets from
the Graphic 1 base.

The hardware DSA field is four-byte aligned. The graphics BIOS additionally
restricts the Graphic 1 display start to a 128-byte multiple in two-screen
mode. Both proposed starts satisfy both restrictions. Graphic 1 has no
horizontal or vertical wraparound; each selected page is nevertheless a
complete 160-byte-pitch, 200-line display and does not require wraparound.

**Hypothesis verdict:** two 320x200x4-bpp sprite pages can coexist in Graphic 1
and can be selected with `DSA1`. This is supported by period documentation and
the active VAEG readout path.

## 5. Graphic 0/1 composition

`GRMODE` bit 10 selects single-plane operation and bit 11 selects two graphics
screens. `GRRES` selects 4 bpp and 320 logical dots independently for G0 and
G1. The graphics BIOS provides the complete mode transition, so the proposed
M2 initialization is the documented `INT 8fh` function 0 call with `AH=00h`,
`BX=e00eh`, and `CX=0404h`. The `BX` fields select single-plane, two screens,
display enabled, 320 dots on both screens, and 200 lines; `CL=4` and `CH=4`
select 4-bpp pixels for G0 and G1. The call's return in `AX` must be checked
before touching GVRAM. This BIOS transition avoids constructing an incomplete
TSP timing transition from guessed register constants.

For direct register terminology, priority slot 0 is highest. The documented
palette-source codes are `Ah` for G0 and `Bh` for G1. Thus a G1-over-G0-only
composition is represented by `COLCOMP=00abh`: G1 in slot 0, G0 in slot 1,
and unused lower-priority slots. VAEG consumes the low nibble first and selects
the first nontransparent pixel, matching this ordering.

Port `0126h` is Graphic 1's 16-bit transparent-color mask. Setting bit 0 makes
G1 color index 0 transparent at composition time. Port `0124h` controls the
corresponding G0 mask; the background will leave all of its 16 colors opaque.

## 6. SGP BITBLT and transparency semantics

The SGP uses a private 22-bit address space. Main RAM is at
`000000h-09ffffh`, with CPU and SGP physical addresses equal, and GVRAM is at
`200000h-23ffffh`. Command tables must reside in main RAM and all commands and
parameters are 16-bit words. `SET_WORK` names a live, even-addressed 58-byte
work area.

Each source or destination block descriptor contains:

1. pixel mode and starting dot within the first 16-bit word;
2. width in pixels;
3. height in pixels;
4. byte pitch (`FBW`);
5. low address word; and
6. high address word.

The documented raw `BITBLT` mode uses `TP-MOD=1` to skip source pixels whose
value is zero and logical operation 5 to copy the source. With forward
vertical and horizontal traversal, the exact mode word is `0105h`. Period
documentation requires `HD=0` when transparency is enabled, which this mode
satisfies. VAEG implements the same source-zero mask and ROP 5 behavior.

Two independent zero-color mechanisms are required:

1. `BITBLT TP-MOD=1` prevents zero pixels in the RAM sprite bitmap from
   overwriting the hidden G1 page; and
2. Graphic 1 transparent-mask bit 0 makes the zero-filled portions of the
   displayed G1 page reveal Graphic 0.

No CPU mask or pixel-copy loop is needed.

## 7. SGP command and completion flow

The proposed per-frame list in main RAM is:

~~~text
SET_WORK       main-RAM 58-byte work area
SET_COLOR      0000h
CLS            hidden G1 page, 0x3e80 words
for each sprite in painter order:
    SET_SOURCE RAM bitmap descriptor
    SET_DESTINATION hidden-page descriptor
    BITBLT     0105h
END
~~~

The Users Club technical text `4.TXT` section 4.10 defines the four CLS
parameters as a 32-bit start address followed by a 32-bit region size in
words. `0x3e80` is therefore 16,000 words, exactly one 32,000-byte page; it is
not a guessed count-minus-one encoding. Sprite X positions are encoded using
the aligned destination word address plus the descriptor's start-dot field;
CPU code does not touch destination pixels.

The CPU writes the even command-list physical address as two word I/O cycles:
the low word at `0500h` and the high word at `0502h`. It starts the SGP by
writing 1 to byte port `0506h`, and polls `0506h` bit 0 until it clears. The
word-cycle requirement is confirmed by the VA BIOS disassembly; VAEG's byte-lane
I/O model does not reproduce a hardware hang caused by byte access to these
ports.
VAEG clears busy when `END` executes. The documented completion interrupt at
level 8 exists, but polling is the simpler first correctness path and is fully
implemented in VAEG.

## 8. Vertical blank and page exchange

TSP status port `0142h`, bit 6 (`40h`), is the documented vertical-blank
status. VAEG sets it when the display interval ends and clears it when the next
display interval begins. VAEG rebuilds graphics raster state, including FB1
`DSA`, at that display start.

The proposed flip sequence is therefore:

~~~text
wait for SGP busy = 0
wait until (IN 0142h AND 40h) = 0
wait until (IN 0142h AND 40h) != 0
write DSA1 as words at ports 022eh (low) and 0230h (high)
swap front/back variables
~~~

Waiting for a complete low-to-high transition prevents a late SGP completion
from flipping partway through an already active vertical blank. The DSA write
then precedes VAEG's next display-start sampling. No TSP hardware sprites are
involved.

The system status port `0040h` also exposes a VRTC signal and VAEG has a
separate CRT interrupt path. The first demo should poll `0142h.VB` because it
is both the direct documented TSP vertical-blank status and the state used by
VAEG's display scheduling. No VBLANK interrupt behavior is assumed.

## 9. Original proposed implementation path

The next milestones should use a new directory such as
`tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/` and a CMake-generated
`guest/sgpdemo.com` artifact:

1. **M2 video bring-up:** use graphics BIOS function 0 for the complete
   320x200, 4-bpp, single-plane, two-screen transition; initialize palettes,
   buffers, windows, composition, and transparency; draw only the diagnostic
   G0 checkerboard and a simple G1 overlay.
2. **M3 transparent BITBLT:** add an even-addressed main-RAM command list,
   work area, and an 8x8 or 16x16 4-bpp bitmap; prove `0105h` source-zero
   transparency into G1.
3. **M4 multiple sprites:** add English-named sprite records containing
   position, velocity, dimensions, bitmap pointer, and priority; update
   coordinates on the CPU and emit SGP commands in painter order.
4. **M5 double buffering:** render `CLS` plus every sprite into the hidden
   page, wait for SGP completion, then switch `DSA1` during `0142h.VB`.
5. **M6 stress and counters:** enable at least 16 sprites plus configurable
   bullets and report frames, commands, BITBLTs, transferred pixels/bytes,
   sprite count, flips, and detectable missed vertical blanks on exit.

Sprite bitmap widths should initially be multiples of four pixels, keeping
their 4-bpp row pitch even and simplifying source descriptors. Destination X
may still be arbitrary because the start-dot field handles pixel alignment.
Draw order will define priority; later records overwrite earlier nonzero
pixels on the hidden page.

## 10. M4 input and FPS timing extension

The period keyboard BIOS material identifies `INT 82h` as the keyboard
service. Primitive function `0ah` senses whether a key is available without
waiting, and function `09h` consumes one key and returns its scan code in
`AH`. Cursor Up is scan `3ah` and cursor Down is scan `3dh`. M4 uses those
calls to adjust the active sprite count between 1 and 32; `+` and `-` are
printable fallbacks. No PC-compatible extended-key encoding is assumed.

The period calendar BIOS material defines `INT 8ch`, function `02h`, as the
read-current-time call and returns seconds in `DH`. M4 counts completed frames
between changes of that value, discards the first partial interval, and clamps
the three-digit display to 999.

The counter value only selects six main-RAM bitmap pointers. The `FPS` label
and three digits are emitted after the balls as transparent SGP BITBLTs into
Graphic 1 at the upper right. The CPU does not draw the glyph pixels, and this
extension does not write Graphic 1's display-start address.

## 11. M5 implementation update

The buildable NASM source now implements the proposed two-page path.
Graphic 1 page A is SGP `220000h` with DSA1 `020000h`; page B is SGP
`227d00h` with DSA1 `027d00h`. Both pages are 320x200x4-bpp surfaces
of `0x7d00` bytes inside the 128-KiB Graphic 1 region.

Each frame selects the page opposite `draw_page_index`, emits SGP CLS
and transparent BITBLTs there, and waits for SGP busy to clear. It then
waits for port `0142h` bit 6 to make a low-to-high VBLANK transition and
writes DSA1 low and high words through `022eh` and `0230h`. The page
index is toggled only after that write. Startup renders both pages before
display enable, so no uninitialized page is exposed.

The ball bitmap is a pre-rendered 24x24 raster sphere with a smooth light
gradient, white upper-left highlight, dark lower-right edge, and a transparent
source-zero silhouette. Sixteen hue variants are stored in main RAM; color 0
remains transparent and all sphere pixels still come from SGP BITBLT. The CPU
does not mask or copy them. The FPS label is followed by a C label and four
ball-count digits, and the active prefix can grow from 1 to 256 records.
Records 17 through 48 use an 8x8 transparent bullet bitmap; later records
reuse the shaded 24x24 ball variants for the remaining stress capacity.

The command buffer is 4,283 words (8,566 bytes) at the 256-record limit; the
initial 16-sprite frame emits 443 words and 27 BITBLTs. The 48-record
ball-plus-bullet prefix emits 955 words and 59 BITBLTs, with 11,572 source
pixels and 5,786 source bytes. The 256-record frame transfers 131,380 source
pixels and 65,690 source bytes; these are source rectangles presented to SGP,
not a claim that every pixel is nonzero after transparency rejection.

The M5 build passed NASM assembly, the dedicated CMake guest target, and
headless VAEG execution on a disposable D88. G5 human measurement recorded
about 57 FPS at 26 active 24x24 spheres and about 28 FPS at 27 spheres.
The current M5 gate is complete; this workload cliff is retained as an M6
optimization input rather than treated as a VAEG correctness defect.

## 12. M6 stress and instrumentation update

M6 keeps the M5 page architecture and adds a bounded stress prefix of 256
records. The first 16 records are the established shaded spheres, the next
32 are 8x8 4-bpp transparent bullets, and records 49 through 256 are further
spheres. Up/+/Down/- still changes only the active prefix, so a tester can
measure the transition from balls to bullets without changing the command-list
format or using a CPU pixel loop.

The command builder counts command words and BITBLTs in the current frame. For
each BITBLT it also counts source pixels (`width * height`) and source bytes
(`pitch * height`); the CLS and command-list control words are not included in
those transfer counters. Completed frames, VBLANK-synchronized page flips,
and both per-frame and 32-bit cumulative transfer counters are retained in
main RAM. A VBLANK counter increments only when the bounded low/high polling
window is exhausted. On ESC, after restoring the saved video state, DOS prints
all counters and the active sprite count. The cumulative values wrap at
`0xffffffff`, while the per-frame values are 16-bit and sufficient for 256
records.

Machine checks for this M6 candidate were:

- NASM assembled the default M6 `sgp_sprite_demo.asm` to a 20,734-byte COM;
- the dedicated `sgpsprite_com` CMake target rebuilt successfully;
- a normal 16-record headless VAEG run on a disposable copy of
  `docs/disks/pcengine110-bootonly.d88` completed and produced a screen dump;
- a temporary, uncommitted build with `SPRITE_INITIAL_COUNT` set to 256
  completed the same VAEG launch without an emulator or SGP error; and
- the source still contains no CPU sprite-pixel copy or masking loop.

The 26-at-about-57-FPS and 27-at-about-28-FPS human measurements remain the
M5 workload reference. M6's 256-record launch is a correctness/stability
stress check, not a claim that 256 24x24 BITBLTs will sustain display rate.
This section remains an implementation candidate until the maintainer passes
the M6 visual/human gate.

## 13. M6 rebuild correction and milestone binaries

The first M6 distribution candidate exposed two separate packaging/runtime
errors during the human review. The D88 had been made with the `vanilla`
workflow, so it retained the four PC-Engine system files. The replacement
artifact is made with `pcengine_disk.py data` and an install payload containing
only the six milestone programs:

~~~text
A:\SGPDEMO1.COM
A:\SGPDEMO2.COM
A:\SGPDEMO3.COM
A:\SGPDEMO4.COM
A:\SGPDEMO5.COM
A:\SGPDEMO6.COM
~~~

The compressed distribution is `tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgpdemo.d88.xz`.
It is a data disk, not a standalone boot disk; a separate bootable system D88
is mounted in FDD1 for launch. No `ENGINEIO.SYS`, `PCENGINE.SYS`,
`ADVGBIOS.SYS`, or `PCENGINE.COM` is included in the distribution image.

The first COM also used long conditional branches for the sprite and FPS
loops. NASM encoded those branches as `0f 85`, but the uPD9002 instruction
model treats the `0fh` prefix as its reserved/extended instruction family,
not as an 8086 near conditional branch. As a result, the command list stopped
after one sphere and one `F` glyph. This was a demo instruction-selection bug;
no VAEG core behavior was changed. The corrected source keeps the loop counter
in RAM, uses a short conditional exit, and uses an unconditional near jump for
the long back edge.

The source now accepts `-dMILESTONE_STAGE=1` through `-dMILESTONE_STAGE=6`.
The reproducible helper `build_milestone_coms.sh` emits the six runnable
names. M1 is a text hardware-inventory diagnostic; M2 initializes the video
mode and leaves the checkerboard visible; M3 uses one transparent SGP BITBLT;
M4 uses multiple animated records; M5 uses the hidden-page path with 1-256 ball records and no M6 bullet
stress prefix; and M6 is the full stress/counter build.

The resulting COM sizes are:

~~~text
SGPDEMO1.COM 20718
SGPDEMO2.COM 20660
SGPDEMO3.COM  8690
SGPDEMO4.COM  8692
SGPDEMO5.COM 20746
SGPDEMO6.COM 20734
~~~

A traced run of the corrected M6 COM emitted 16 sphere BITBLTs plus 11 FPS/
count glyph BITBLTs (27 BITBLTs per frame), with all 16 sphere source addresses
present before the glyph commands. The trace produced 37,709 `END` commands and
1,018,143 source/BITBLT commands during the bounded run. This is the machine
check for the earlier one-sprite/`F`-only symptom; visual M6 acceptance remains
a human gate.

## 14. Limitations and open checks

- The M1 inventory itself did not build a NASM program or run VAEG; the
  M5 and M6 updates above record the later machine checks.
- The tracked video reconstruction labels direct 320x200 field programming as
  a candidate pending hardware tests. The documented graphics BIOS mode is
  therefore the safer initialization interface for M2.
- VAEG's `TP=2/3` handling and SGP scan commands are incomplete. The proposed
  demo uses only documented `TP=1`, which is implemented.
- VAEG's SGP timing includes provisional contention costs. Smoothness and
  maximum sprite count must be measured rather than inferred.
- Some palette/composition registers are not readable through current VAEG
  I/O handlers. M2 must establish a BIOS-based exit/reset sequence before
  claiming that display and palette state are restored safely.
- The historical advanced-graphics BIOS has its own full-scene page-exchange
  service, but it does not by itself prove the required persistent G0
  background plus G1 sprite-layer arrangement. Direct, documented `DSA1`
  exchange preserves that arrangement and is the selected path.
- The optional 1-bpp expansion path is documented and present in VAEG, but it
  remains outside the first six SGP demo milestones and must not delay the
  4-bpp demo.

No VAEG defect was demonstrated by this static inventory. Any later mismatch
must be classified with a minimal guest reproducer before emulator behavior is
changed.

# PC-88VA 128 MB MO support plan

## Scope and current result

The PC-88.gr.jp packages for SCHD 1.55T and VA128MO, together with the OSL
STEST 1.15 package, were audited and are now accepted as optional inputs to
[`build-sasi-development-disks.sh`](../../tools/pc88va/build-sasi-development-disks.sh).
The builder verifies the original archive bytes, keeps each archive under
`A:\ARCHIVE`, and installs the runnable files and manuals in `A:\SYS`,
`A:\BIN`, and `A:\DOC` on both the VA and VA2 40 MB development HDIs.  The
fixed-HDD `CONFIG.SYS` remains unchanged: an MO option must not silently alter
the known-good boot path.  Formatting a real MO is deliberately not automated.

The package listing pages are the provenance references:

- [SCHD155T (gnum 448)](http://www.pc88.gr.jp/softlib/index.php?action=list_file&anum=2&gnum=448)
- [VA128MO (gnum 449)](http://www.pc88.gr.jp/softlib/index.php?action=list_file&anum=2&gnum=449)
- [STEST115 (gnum 450)](http://www.pc88.gr.jp/softlib/index.php?action=list_file&anum=2&gnum=450)
- [STEST115.LZH (OSL driver archive)](https://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~pumpkin/hlabo/osl/driver/STEST115.LZH)
- [ST115SRC.LZH (OSL source archive)](https://www2u.biglobe.ne.jp/~pumpkin/hlabo/osl/driver/ST115SRC.LZH)

With the three archives in the verified development cache, the existing
wrapper installs them in both variants alongside the other development
software:

```sh
tools/pc88va/build-sasi-development-disks.sh \
  --output-dir /private/tmp/pc88va-sasi-mo
```

Use `--mo-schd-archive`, `--mo-va128mo-archive`, or `--mo-stest-archive` (or
the corresponding `VAEG_MO_*_ARCHIVE` variables) when the archives are stored
elsewhere.  The wrapper extracts each archive to a temporary host directory;
those extracted files and the generated HDIs are not tracked in Git.

The verified archive identities are:

| archive | bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `SCHD155T.LZH` | 15,360 | `87aebcf7c9bc9c6170a40d0e6ddcce5afdcbb1fa55f1fdeeec815458f7ef065f` |
| `VA128MO.LZH` | 3,584 | `1dc8f366fb56e1761051e9b0c1e8950999ebb6df10ddf1bb91251e2557728a36` |
| `STEST115.LZH` | 107,136 | `6ae981b0010df20a510f85165567add33032241854b147ed47937a59953010bc` |
| `ST115SRC.LZH` | 60,672 | `1192d3a38a4d9444a9b8b021fcd550e61e7b860bc39b67a01868c58e62bc2e51` |

Installed files are:

```text
A:\ARCHIVE\SCHD155T.LZH
A:\ARCHIVE\VA128MO.LZH
A:\ARCHIVE\STEST115.LZH
A:\ARCHIVE\ST115SRC.LZH
A:\SYS\SCHD.SYS
A:\DOC\SCHD.DOC  A:\DOC\SCHD.LOG  A:\DOC\SCHD.TXT

A:\BIN\STEST.EXE  A:\BIN\STESTX.COM  A:\BIN\STEST.BAT
A:\DOC\STEST115.DOC  A:\DOC\COMMAND.DOC  A:\DOC\UTILITY.DOC
```

`STEST115.LZH` is the runnable STEST 1.15 distribution and is expanded into
`A:\BIN` with its manuals in `A:\DOC`.  `ST115SRC.LZH` is retained unchanged
under `A:\ARCHIVE` as the corresponding source distribution; it is not
expanded on the fixed-size FDD image.  Both archives are downloaded and
verified by the SASI builder from the OSL URLs above.

`AUTOEXEC.BAT` already puts `A:\BIN` on `PATH`, so `STESTX.COM` and the
other installed utilities are discoverable.  `STEST.BAT` creates the
machine-specific `STEST55S.EXE` name; the package does not ship that generated
copy.  The VA128MO instructions describe `VBUFF -D1 -B11` and
`STEST55S SFORM` as operator actions.  `SFORM` can physically format or
reassign a medium and must remain an explicit, destructive real-hardware
operation.

## Evidence from the package manuals

`VA128MO.DOC` targets a PC-9801-55/92-compatible SCSI interface and a 3.5-inch
128 MB MO.  It requires PCPLUS, SCHD 1.55 or later, VBUFF, SETDMA, and the
STEST family.  Its semi-IBM example uses SCSI ID 0, `SCHD.SYS -I0 -X -D1`,
and an STEST logical format choice named `3.5" IBM-like`.  SCHD's own manual
describes `-I0..7`, removable-media handling, and larger logical sectors; it
also notes that old `-D` handling changed in later releases.  For that reason
the builder installs the packages but does not add historical MO switches to
the default fixed-HDD `SCHD.SYS -I0` line.

The manual's reported maximum LBA is `248825`.  The capacity arithmetic is
consistent with 128 MiB represented by 262,144 512-byte blocks, with a
filesystem reserving part of the medium.  One OCR-ambiguous line says
`2048 KB (512KB)`; it is not sufficient evidence for a 2,048-byte device
block.  The proposed image contract therefore uses an explicit 512-byte
block size and keeps the logical-sector choice in the guest software layer.

## What VAEG supports today

The current code has a type constant for MO (`fdd/sxsi.h:8-19`), but it is
not a working removable-medium implementation.  `fdd/sxsi.c:114-217` parses
SCSI VHD/HDD files as fixed direct-access disks, accepts only 256/512/1024
byte blocks, and stores no media-present, changed, write-protect, or
prevent-removal state.  `cbus/scsicmd.c:60-71` always returns a fixed HDD
INQUIRY descriptor, and the command path currently covers TUR, REQUEST SENSE,
INQUIRY, MODE SENSE(6), READ CAPACITY(10), and READ/WRITE(6/10), but not
START/STOP UNIT, PREVENT/ALLOW MEDIUM REMOVAL, or media-change/unit-attention
semantics.  The generic read/write backend has no removable-media policy.

The SDL2 menu (`sdl2/gui/gui.cpp:2389-2433`) exposes only SASI and SCSI-ID
fixed-disk slots, and `sdl2/ini.c:348-354` persists only one path per SCSI
slot.  Thus attaching a 128 MB file as an ordinary VHD would make it look
like an HDD and would not reproduce the guest-visible MO contract.

## Proposed implementation by layer

### SCSI/device layer

Keep the existing HDD target behavior as the compatibility path and add an
explicit removable target profile.  Do not infer media type from a filename
extension.  A future MO image should carry a distinct signature/profile (for
example, a versioned VMO container) or an explicit per-slot type in the
configuration.  The target state should include:

- 512-byte physical block size and block count (the 128 MiB profile is
  262,144 blocks before filesystem reservations);
- removable, media-present, write-protected, started/stopped, and
  prevent-removal flags;
- media-changed/unit-attention state and a last-sense record;
- an optional bad-block/reassignment map only after the guest contract is
  measured.

Implement the SCSI state machine above the generic `sxsi_read`/`sxsi_write`
file backend.  INQUIRY should identify a removable direct-access optical
device (RMB set), while TUR, REQUEST SENSE, READ CAPACITY, MODE SENSE/SELECT,
READ/WRITE, START/STOP, and PREVENT/ALLOW must expose the state transitions.
GUI eject/load should become media attach/detach events and set unit
attention; it must not silently format an image.  `FORMAT UNIT`/SFORM should
initially be an explicit unsupported or destructive operation, not a fake
success.  Add isolated command and media-state tests before changing the
phase engine.  The existing 256/512/1024-byte fixed-disk validation should
remain unchanged for HDD images.

### Guest software layer

The package installer is the first, non-destructive step.  It preserves the
known-good boot configuration and exposes the manuals and STEST tools for a
real MO.  A later MO profile can add an opt-in configuration snippet rather
than changing the default:

```dos
DEVICE=A:\SYS\PCPLUS.SYS
DEVICE=A:\SYS\SCHD.SYS -I0 -X
VBUFF -D1 -B11
```

The exact `-D`/logical-sector combination must follow the installed SCHD
revision and the operator's medium.  `STEST55S SFORM` is intentionally left
manual because it performs physical and logical formatting.  Guest QA should
progress from `scan_scsi`, INQUIRY, TUR, READ CAPACITY, and MODE SENSE to
attach/eject and prevent/allow traces; WRITE and FORMAT require separate
evidence.  The package bytes and the existing PCPLUS/SCHD path are kept
separate from emulator implementation so a guest failure identifies the
first layer that diverges.

### GUI layer

Add a distinct “SCSI MO ID n” entry rather than relabeling an HDD slot.  The
chooser should show media type, capacity, present/ejected, writable/read-only,
and write-protect state.  Provide explicit Load/Attach, Eject, and
Prevent/Allow controls; an eject should be rejected while prevent-removal is
active.  Persist both the path and explicit type, not just a path or extension.
The existing SASI/HDD menu and configuration keys must remain compatible.
New-image creation should offer a clearly labelled preformatted MO profile
only when its on-disk format is specified; never overwrite or format a host
file from the ordinary Open dialog.

## Verification order and boundaries

1. Build both development HDIs and verify the installed file list and package
   hashes.  This is implemented and host-testable now.
2. Add a small explicit VMO fixture and test INQUIRY/TUR/REQUEST SENSE/READ
   CAPACITY, then media-change and START/STOP/PREVENT/ALLOW transitions.
3. Compare guest `STEST` traces in VAEG; only then add WRITE or FORMAT behavior.
4. Add the GUI type/media-state controls and persistence.
5. Perform human PC-88VA and PC-88VA2 checks with a disposable 128 MB MO or
   a hardware-authentic image.  A host image mount or a VAEG command test is
   not real-hardware conformance.

The active SCSI path is currently a fixed HDD path.  No SCSI core or GUI code
was changed by the package-install milestone, so fixed HDD boot behavior and
existing SASI/PCPLUS regressions remain isolated.  The next implementation
milestone should begin with an approved media-state contract and a failing
guest trace, not with filename heuristics or a broad SCSI rewrite.

## Status classification

FACT: the three archives and package manuals are checksum-verified and can be
installed reproducibly into both development HDIs.

FACT: current VAEG exposes no complete removable-MO SCSI state machine; the
existing `SXSITYPE_MO` enum value is unused by the command path.

HYPOTHESIS: the observed “MO does not work” symptom is caused by presenting a
removable medium as a fixed HDD and by missing media-state commands.  This is
the leading implementation hypothesis, not a measured guest root cause.

UNRESOLVED: exact physical MO image container, bad-sector behavior, MODE
SENSE pages required by SCHD, and the real VA/VA2 SCSI timing/format contract.

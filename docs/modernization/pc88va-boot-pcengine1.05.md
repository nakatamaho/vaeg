# PC-88VA PC-Engine 1.05 Boot Analysis

## Scope

This document follows one concrete original-PC-88VA boot from the VA ROM IPL
loader into NEC PC-Engine 1.05. It separates four stages that can otherwise
be mistaken for one program:

1. the original-VA ROM boot decision;
2. the disk IPL loaded at `3000:0000`;
3. `ENGINEIO.SYS` and the beginning of `PCENGINE.SYS` loaded at `1340:0000`;
4. the ROM-side OS initialization entered through `F000:940D`.

The preceding ROM decision, including the PC key, SW7, V3 IPL detection, and
V1/V2 fallback, is documented in
[pc88va-boot-sequence.md](pc88va-boot-sequence.md). The original-VA flowchart
is from the [*PC-88VA Technical Manual*, page 12](https://archive.org/details/PC88VA/page/12/mode/2up).

This is static analysis of a maintainer-owned disk and ROM. Neither payload is
distributed by this repository.

## Analyzed Media

| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Disk filename | `PC-Engine 1.05(86U13).d88` |
| File size | 1,338,960 bytes |
| SHA-1 | `7323da5474d8ac12e0a8b72d8d48f34af4da7002` |
| SHA-256 | `35a05a48e8aafab0b746deec280be3072a28f06d6d36c75d760da8b6fb0d6176` |
| D88 disk type | `20h` (2HD) |
| Original-VA ROM | `varom1.rom` |
| ROM SHA-1 | `54536dc03238b4668c8bb76337efade001ec7826` |

The D88 structures were interpreted according to
[fdd/d88head.h](../../fdd/d88head.h). The active loader computes the requested
transfer size as `128 << N`, as shown in
[fdd/fdd_d88.c](../../fdd/fdd_d88.c).

## Boot Sector Form

The first sector header is:

```text
C=0 H=0 R=1 N=3
sectors per track=8
stored data size=0400h
D88 status=00h
```

`N=3` means `128 << 3`, or 1024 bytes. Track 0, side 0 contains eight
1024-byte sectors, and the IPL sector has no D88 error status.

The original-VA ROM begins with a `0200h` transfer count and doubles it when
the detected sector form requires it. For this disk the effective transfer is
therefore `0400h`, and the ROM loads all of C0/H0/R1 at `3000:0000`.

Only the first 512 bytes contain IPL code and data. Bytes `0200h-03FFh` of the
1024-byte sector are zero, but they are still part of the physical sector and
the ROM transfer.

## On-Disk Layout Used By The IPL

The normal 80-cylinder, two-sided area comprises 1,310,720 bytes in 1280
1024-byte sectors after removing D88 per-sector headers. The image also has an
extra C80/H0 track containing 26 256-byte sectors with D88 status `10h`; that
track is not referenced by the boot path analyzed here. The boot-relevant
normal-area layout is:

| LBA | Contents |
| ---: | -------- |
| 0 | 1024-byte IPL sector |
| 1-2 | FAT copy 1 |
| 3-4 | FAT copy 2 |
| 5-10 | Root directory |
| 11-14 | `ENGINEIO.SYS` |
| 15 onward | Start of `PCENGINE.SYS` |

The root directory and FAT12 chains identify:

| File | Start cluster | Size | Initial chain |
| ---- | ------------: | ---: | ------------- |
| `ENGINEIO.SYS` | 2 | 4096 bytes | `2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> FFFh` |
| `PCENGINE.SYS` | 6 | 52,090 bytes | `6 -> 7 -> ... -> 56 -> FFFh` |
| `PCENGINE.SB2` | 57 | 62,250 bytes | Starts at cluster 57 |
| `ADVGBIOS.SYS` | 69 | 30,956 bytes | Starts at cluster 69 |

The two boot files are contiguous at the start of the data area. This is why
the IPL can use one fixed multi-sector transfer rather than performing a
general FAT file lookup.

## IPL Entry At 3000:0000

The original-VA ROM enters the disk IPL at `3000:0000`. Its first instructions
establish a temporary stack in the IPL segment:

```asm
3000:0000  mov ax,3000h
3000:0003  mov ds,ax
3000:0005  cli
3000:0006  mov ss,ax
3000:0008  mov sp,1FFEh
3000:000B  sti
```

The complete top-level control flow is:

```asm
3000:000C  call 00F2h       ; prepare initial work state
3000:000F  call 0109h       ; update control state through port 018Ah
3000:0012  call 0113h       ; detect writable main-memory extent
3000:0015  jc   0034h       ; stop if memory setup fails
3000:0017  call 0100h       ; initialize system work state

3000:001A  cli
3000:001B  sub  bp,1000h    ; reserve stack below detected memory limit
3000:001F  mov  ss,bp
3000:0021  mov  sp,FFFEh
3000:0024  sti

3000:0025  call 0036h       ; prepare disk state and load the next stage
3000:0028  jc   0034h       ; stop on load failure
3000:002A  call 1340:0000   ; enter ENGINEIO.SYS
3000:002F  call F000:940D   ; enter ROM-side OS initialization
3000:0034  jmp  0034h       ; terminal path if control returns
```

The memory detector reads the original-VA memory switch through port `0152h`,
probes memory in `2000h`-paragraph steps, and leaves the detected upper bound
in `BP`. The permanent IPL stack is then placed one `1000h`-paragraph block
below that bound. A memory-probe failure and a next-stage load failure both
converge on the loop at `3000:0034`.

## Disk Parameter Setup And Stage-Two Read

The routine at `3000:0036` uses the zero-filled second half of the IPL sector
as work space. It constructs a disk control/parameter block beginning at
`3000:0200`, selects a ROM disk-service descriptor at `F000:9410` or
`F000:9420`, and calls `F000:DCFA` to populate media-dependent fields.

The IPL then calculates the second-stage read:

```asm
mov ax,1C00h
div word [disk_parameter + 0Dh]  ; bytes per sector

mov ax,[disk_parameter + 14h]   ; first data-sector LBA
mov [read_lba],ax
mov [read_count],cx
mov [destination_offset],0000h
mov [destination_segment],1340h
```

For this disk:

```text
bytes per sector = 0400h
read count       = 1C00h / 0400h = 7 sectors
first data LBA   = 11
destination      = 1340:0000
```

The far call to `F000:F110` performs the ROM disk-service transfer. It reads
LBA 11 through 17, inclusive, for a total of `1C00h` bytes.

## Resulting Memory Layout

| Guest address | Physical range | Loaded contents |
| ------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| `1340:0000-0FFF` | `13400h-143FFh` | All 4096 bytes of `ENGINEIO.SYS` |
| `1340:1000-1BFF` | `14400h-14FFFh` | First 3072 bytes of `PCENGINE.SYS` |
| `1500:0000` onward | `15000h` onward | IPL/ROM system work area |
| `3000:0000-03FF` | `30000h-303FFh` | Original 1024-byte IPL sector |

The IPL therefore does not load all of PC-Engine 1.05. It loads one complete
bootstrap driver and enough of the following driver for the ROM/DOS startup
path to continue.

## ENGINEIO.SYS Entry At 1340:0000

The entry code first checks the model word at `F000:FFFE`:

```asm
1340:0000  call 000Ch
1340:0003  jnz  000Bh
1340:0005  call 001Bh
1340:0008  call 003Fh
1340:000B  retf

1340:000C  mov  di,F000h
1340:000F  mov  es,di
1340:0011  mov  di,FFFEh
1340:0014  mov  ax,[es:di]
1340:0017  cmp  ax,FFFFh
1340:001A  ret
```

`FFFFh` identifies the original PC-88VA. On that model, `ENGINEIO.SYS`
installs far-jump stubs in segment `1088h` and records ROM-service hooks in
the system work area. On a VA2/VA3 identification value, this original-VA
patch path is skipped.

This model check is direct evidence that the code reached at `1340:0000` is
not merely generic DOS data: it is the original-VA PC-Engine integration
layer.

## PCENGINE.SYS Header At 1340:1000

The next loaded sector begins with a DOS character-device header:

```text
next device pointer = FFFF:FFFF
attributes          = 8000h
strategy entry      = 0016h
interrupt entry     = 0021h
device name         = "__ENGINE"
```

The root directory identifies this region as the beginning of
`PCENGINE.SYS`. The complete file is 52,090 bytes, so the three sectors loaded
by the IPL are only its initial bootstrap-visible portion. The exact later
loader call that brings in the remainder still needs a runtime trace.

## PCENGINE.SB2 And SYS2.COM

### Alternate Sound Board II Driver

PC-Engine 1.05 carries two implementations of the `__ENGINE` DOS character
device:

| File | Size | SHA-256 | Guest sound interface |
| ---- | ---: | ------- | --------------------- |
| `PCENGINE.SYS` | 52,090 bytes | `c3e2cc06c7007f05a43ed8c49da4262c47567b86ef501f641d288ab47ec51815` | Original-VA OPN path |
| `PCENGINE.SB2` | 62,250 bytes | `fdcac3749ff449d0d69860affaca0e0194e559fe24e27930a22a1d3d575d00c7` | Sound Board II OPNA path |

Both files have the same DOS device name, `__ENGINE`, and the same strategy
and interrupt entry offsets, `0016h` and `0021h`. `PCENGINE.SB2` is therefore
an alternate implementation of `PCENGINE.SYS`, not a data file consumed by
the normal driver. It identifies itself internally as:

```text
NEC PC-Engine v1.05
Copyright (C) 1987,1988 NEC Corporation
```

The normal driver uses the primary OPN ports `0044h/0045h` and contains no
direct `0046h/0047h` I/O instructions. The `.SB2` driver also accesses the
OPNA extended ports directly:

| Direct instruction | `PCENGINE.SYS` | `PCENGINE.SB2` |
| ------------------ | -------------: | --------------: |
| `IN AL,46h` | 0 | 9 |
| `OUT 46h,AL` | 0 | 7 |
| `IN AL,47h` | 0 | 3 |
| `OUT 47h,AL` | 0 | 5 |

Those ports are the Sound Board II extended address/status and data ports in
the active implementation, as documented by
[iova/boardsb2.c](../../iova/boardsb2.c). The `.SB2` body includes the related
rhythm, ADPCM, and recording-facing routines. This direct hardware access is
the decisive evidence that `SB2` denotes Sound Board II.

The earlier unnumbered Sound Board II system disk instead carries its OPNA
driver under the canonical name `PCENGINE.SYS`. Its relationship to the 1.05
alternate driver is analyzed in
[pc88va-boot-pcengine-soundboard2.md](pc88va-boot-pcengine-soundboard2.md).

### How SYS2.COM Activates The Alternate Driver

`ENGINEIO.SYS` always emits:

```text
DEVICE=PCENGINE.SYS
```

It never names `PCENGINE.SB2`, so the `.SB2` file is not loaded merely because
it is present in the root directory. `SYS2.COM` contains these three paths:

```text
A:\PCENGINE.SYS
A:\PCENGINE.VA
A:\PCENGINE.SB2
```

Its replacement path uses DOS `INT 21h`, function `56h` to perform:

```text
PCENGINE.SYS -> PCENGINE.VA
PCENGINE.SB2 -> PCENGINE.SYS
```

If the second rename fails, it restores `PCENGINE.VA` to `PCENGINE.SYS`.
Consequently, `PCENGINE.VA` is the preserved normal-driver copy and the Sound
Board II driver becomes loadable under the canonical name expected by
`ENGINEIO.SYS`. The exact user-facing procedure that invokes `SYS2.COM` is not
established by this static analysis, but the file-selection and rollback
mechanism are explicit in the executable.

The analyzed `SYS2.COM` has SHA-256:

```text
f9dc585c161e46f35a69f38f2d819288c88b570ef83e10e10f0d2b7c2d75faff
```

### Resident Main-Memory Footprint

During DOS device initialization, each driver returns its resident-end
address in request-packet fields `0Eh/10h`. On an original VA, identified by
`F000:FFFE == FFFFh`, the returned addresses are:

| Active driver | Resident-end address | Paragraph-rounded image size |
| ------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------: |
| Normal `PCENGINE.SYS` | `CS:C337h` | 49,984 bytes |
| Sound Board II driver | `CS:EAB7h` | 60,096 bytes |

The Sound Board II implementation therefore retains approximately 10 KiB
more main-memory driver code than the normal OPN implementation. Its complete
62,250-byte file is not all resident: the initialization tail beginning at
`EAB7h` can be discarded after initialization.

On a VA2/VA3 model identifier, both drivers return `CS:004Dh` instead. Only
the 77-byte device header and dispatch stub need remain, with the later model's
ROM-side implementation providing the corresponding environment. These are
resident V30 main-memory ranges; they are not Sound Board II sound RAM or
ADPCM sample RAM.

The three `PCENGINE.SYS` sectors exposed at `1340:1000` by the IPL are a
separate bootstrap placement. The final DOS device instance is loaded at a
DOS-assigned segment and uses the resident-end address above to release its
initialization tail.

## ROM-Side OS Handoff

After `ENGINEIO.SYS` returns, the IPL calls `F000:940D`. In the analyzed
original-VA ROM this entry jumps to `F000:B61C`, which performs broad ROM-side
OS initialization: work-area setup, memory sizing, interrupt-vector setup,
device-table setup, and subsequent initialization calls.

The practical chain is therefore:

```text
Original-VA ROM boot decision
  -> load C0/H0/R1 at 3000:0000
  -> execute the disk IPL
  -> read LBA 11-17 at 1340:0000
  -> execute ENGINEIO.SYS at 1340:0000
  -> install original-VA PC-Engine hooks
  -> expose the PCENGINE.SYS header at 1340:1000
  -> enter ROM-side OS initialization through F000:940D
  -> continue PC-Engine 1.05 startup
```

Thus `3000:0000` is the PC-Engine disk's IPL, not the PC-Engine body itself.
The first clearly PC-Engine-specific execution occurs at `1340:0000`, the
`ENGINEIO.SYS` entry.

## Confirmed And Unresolved Points

### Confirmed By Static Evidence

- The boot sector is a valid 1024-byte C0/H0/R1 sector with D88 status `00h`.
- The ROM transfers that sector to `3000:0000` and enters it there.
- The IPL computes a seven-sector, `1C00h`-byte read to `1340:0000`.
- Those seven sectors contain all of `ENGINEIO.SYS` and the first three
  sectors of `PCENGINE.SYS`.
- `ENGINEIO.SYS` tests the original-VA model identifier and installs hooks.
- The following data begins with the `__ENGINE` DOS device header.
- `PCENGINE.SB2` is the alternate Sound Board II/OPNA implementation of the
  same `__ENGINE` device.
- `SYS2.COM` safely renames the `.SB2` file to the canonical
  `PCENGINE.SYS` name expected by `ENGINEIO.SYS`.
- On an original VA, the normal and Sound Board II drivers request resident
  ends at `C337h` and `EAB7h`, respectively.
- The IPL then enters ROM-side initialization through `F000:940D`.

### Still Requiring Runtime Trace Or Additional Documentation

- Exact names and contracts of every ROM service called by the IPL.
- Exact meaning of the IPL's `INT 80h` operations after the stage-two read.
- The later path that loads the remainder of `PCENGINE.SYS`.
- The exact user-facing operating procedure around `SYS2.COM`.
- Which ROM-side initialization call becomes the final non-returning transfer
  into the running PC-Engine environment.
- Whether VA2/VA3 uses the same disk layout with a different `ENGINEIO.SYS`
  path or relies entirely on its later ROM initialization.

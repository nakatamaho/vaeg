# PC-88VA PC-Engine Sound Board II System Disk Analysis

## Scope

This document analyzes the original-PC-88VA disk named
`PC-Engine システムディスク (サウンドボードII対応版).d88`. It follows the
boot path from the disk IPL through the initial PC-Engine drivers and then
identifies the static evidence for Sound Board II support.

The preceding original-VA ROM decision, including the PC key, SW7, V3 IPL
detection, and V1/V2 fallback, is documented in
[pc88va-boot-sequence.md](pc88va-boot-sequence.md). The corresponding analyses
of the numbered PC-Engine releases are:

- [PC-Engine 1.00](pc88va-boot-pcengine1.00.md)
- [PC-Engine 1.05](pc88va-boot-pcengine1.05.md)
- [PC-Engine 1.1](pc88va-boot-pcengine1.1.md)

This is static analysis of a maintainer-owned disk and ROM. Neither payload is
distributed by this repository.

## Analyzed Media

| Item | Value |
| ---- | ----- |
| Disk filename | `PC-Engine システムディスク (サウンドボードII対応版).d88` |
| File size | 1,331,888 bytes |
| SHA-1 | `788ea533cfefb3e8755fe976f380d8e20507af24` |
| SHA-256 | `1cdee106d86ff9299755207c7ce2f56d7241d911d5ac00bd7cb3cc0470cf9ebb` |
| D88 internal name | `HxCFE` |
| D88 write-protect byte | `00h` |
| D88 disk type | `20h` (2HD) |
| Original-VA ROM | `varom1.rom` |
| ROM SHA-1 | `54536dc03238b4668c8bb76337efade001ec7826` |

The D88 structures were interpreted according to
[fdd/d88head.h](../../fdd/d88head.h). The active loader computes a sector size
as `128 << N`, as shown in [fdd/fdd_d88.c](../../fdd/fdd_d88.c).

## Physical Disk Form

The image has 160 populated D88 track entries, C0/H0 through C79/H1. Every
track has eight sectors, and all 1,280 sectors have the same form:

```text
N=3
stored data size=0400h
D88 status=00h
```

The decoded disk area is therefore 1,310,720 bytes. Unlike the analyzed
PC-Engine 1.05 image, this image has no extra C80/H0 track. No sector has a
stored D88 CRC/error status.

The first sector, C0/H0/R1, is a 1,024-byte IPL sector with SHA-256:

```text
af3b7b80ec48b8b5009a1bae7990c95a9e054a8b789c13c481b666e80cdef490
```

Its executable routines occupy offsets `0000h-0168h`. Later bytes are disk
parameter and work-area initial data, not a continuation of the instruction
stream. This IPL is distinct from the IPLs analyzed for PC-Engine 1.00, 1.05,
and 1.1. Only the initial 13-byte segment/stack setup is common.

## On-Disk Layout

The boot-relevant raw-sector layout is:

| LBA | Contents |
| ---: | -------- |
| 0 | 1,024-byte IPL sector |
| 1-2 | FAT copy 1 |
| 3-4 | FAT copy 2 |
| 5-10 | Root directory |
| 11-14 | `ENGINEIO.SYS` |
| 15 onward | `PCENGINE.SYS` |

The root directory contains:

| File | Start cluster | Size | Directory timestamp |
| ---- | ------------: | ---: | ------------------- |
| `ENGINEIO.SYS` | 2 | 4,096 | 1987-09-10 19:48:18 |
| `PCENGINE.SYS` | 6 | 59,956 | 1987-10-20 19:45:12 |
| `PCENGINE.COM` | 65 | 5 | 1987-10-15 11:00:00 |
| `ADVGBIOS.SYS` | 66 | 16,356 | 1986-03-16 15:11:28 |
| `CHKDSK.COM` | 82 | 8,558 | 1987-08-26 15:46:14 |
| `HDFORM.COM` | 91 | 3,750 | 1987-03-05 14:44:12 |
| `NECGAIJI.DAT` | 95 | 8,664 | 1987-03-03 23:30:30 |
| `VA11SAMP.BAS` | 104 | 8,349 | 1987-03-03 23:24:44 |
| `KYBDSAMP.BAS` | 113 | 6,534 | 1987-10-15 16:41:42 |
| `RTHMSAMP.BAS` | 120 | 15,784 | 1987-10-13 17:58:06 |

There is no separate `PCENGINE.SB2` file. The boot configuration still names
`PCENGINE.SYS`, and the Sound Board II implementation is integrated into that
file. This differs from PC-Engine 1.05, whose disk carries both a normal
`PCENGINE.SYS` and a larger `PCENGINE.SB2` alternative.

Selected component identities are:

| Component | SHA-256 | Comparison |
| --------- | ------- | ---------- |
| IPL sector | `af3b7b80ec48b8b5009a1bae7990c95a9e054a8b789c13c481b666e80cdef490` | Unique among the four analyzed disks |
| `ENGINEIO.SYS` | `7ded86927015579c3aded10d97bf8751d065131df06498d43021717a04f65183` | Byte-identical to PC-Engine 1.05/1.1 |
| `PCENGINE.SYS` | `afb53e0634ab1d706c75c9541b619cd77b96958f8b759db5e94369979c3f3cdc` | Sound Board II-specific integrated driver |
| `PCENGINE.COM` | `bfbcdfa65eee2acd963cce8036c2c708fb46772a0ce156a807f0e5f98af8c163` | Same five-byte far jump used by the other analyzed releases |
| `ADVGBIOS.SYS` | `8d9b646deec147744763b1bd4eb3693705ed1b0a9e5f5e6d6457ffe8957000bc` | Byte-identical to PC-Engine 1.00 |
| `RTHMSAMP.BAS` | `dc7beaa7f61132c2a696c871195966fb3df62487016939fc5fe11fd9b40daa42` | Rhythm sample, embedded label `Version 1.0` |

`ADVGBIOS.SYS` identifies itself as:

```text
Graphics BIOS Ver 1.00 87/03/01 (with ROM03,04,05)
```

The dates and component reuse show that this is a distinct 1987 composition,
but they do not establish an official PC-Engine version number. No reliable
PC-Engine version string was found in this disk's `PCENGINE.SYS`, so this
document does not assign one.

## IPL Entry At 3000:0000

The original-VA ROM loads C0/H0/R1 at `3000:0000`. The disk IPL begins with
the standard temporary segment and stack setup:

```asm
3000:0000  mov ax,3000h
3000:0003  mov ds,ax
3000:0005  cli
3000:0006  mov ss,ax
3000:0008  mov sp,1FFEh
3000:000B  sti
```

Its top-level path is:

```asm
3000:000C  call 00EEh       ; initialize four work bytes to FFh
3000:000F  call 00FCh       ; set bit 0 in master PIC mask port 018Ah
3000:0012  call 0106h       ; initialize work pointers and probe memory
3000:0015  jc   0031h       ; stop if no writable region is found

3000:0017  cli
3000:0018  sub  bp,1000h
3000:001C  mov  ss,bp
3000:001E  mov  sp,FFFEh
3000:0021  sti

3000:0022  call 0032h       ; prepare disk state and load the next stage
3000:0025  jc   0031h       ; stop on load failure
3000:0027  call 1340:0000   ; enter ENGINEIO.SYS
3000:002C  call F000:940D   ; enter ROM-side OS initialization
3000:0031  hlt              ; terminal path if control returns
```

The active emulator maps `018Ah` to the master interrupt controller mask, as
shown in [io/pic.c](../../io/pic.c). The IPL preserves its current value and
sets bit 0 before continuing.

The `00EEh` routine writes two `FFFFh` words at `1500:3E93`. Static analysis
does not establish the semantic name of these four work bytes. They should
not be labeled as Sound Board II state without runtime or ROM evidence.

## Memory Detection

The routine at `3000:0106` installs two work-area values:

```text
1040:05F8 = 1500h
1040:05FA = 0400h
```

It then reads port `0152h`, temporarily selects a `B000h` memory mapping,
reads `B000:1FC4`, restores the original port value, and reduces the result to
three bits. That value determines an initial memory limit. The IPL probes
downward in `2000h`-paragraph, or 128 KiB, steps using the sentinel `6DDBh`
until it finds writable memory. The resulting upper bound is returned in
`BP`, and the permanent stack is placed one `1000h`-paragraph block below it.

This detector is more hardware-aware than the simpler probe in the analyzed
PC-Engine 1.00 IPL. Its exact interpretation of the bits read through
`B000:1FC4` remains unresolved.

## Stage-Two Read

The routine at `3000:0032` builds a disk parameter block at `3000:0200`, a
second work pointer at `3000:0400`, and selects the ROM descriptor at
`F000:9410` or `F000:9420` according to `0040:2F0F`. It calls `F000:DCFA` to
populate media-dependent fields and then calculates:

```asm
mov ax,1C00h
div word [disk_parameter + 0Dh]  ; bytes per sector

mov ax,[disk_parameter + 14h]   ; first data-sector LBA
mov [read_lba],ax
mov [read_count],cx
mov [destination_offset],0000h
mov [destination_segment],1340h
```

For this disk:

```text
bytes per sector = 0400h
read count       = 1C00h / 0400h = 7 sectors
first data LBA   = 11
destination      = 1340:0000
```

The call to `F000:F110` therefore reads LBA 11 through 17, inclusive:

| Guest address | Loaded contents |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| `1340:0000-0FFF` | All 4,096 bytes of `ENGINEIO.SYS` |
| `1340:1000-1BFF` | First 3,072 bytes of `PCENGINE.SYS` |
| `1500:0000` onward | IPL/ROM system work area |
| `3000:0000-03FF` | Original 1,024-byte IPL sector |

The post-read `INT 80h` operations match the general form used by the later
PC-Engine IPLs, but their exact service contracts remain unresolved.

## ENGINEIO.SYS

`ENGINEIO.SYS` is byte-identical to the 4,096-byte file on the analyzed
PC-Engine 1.05 disk. Its entry checks the model word at `F000:FFFE`:

```asm
1340:000C  mov  di,F000h
1340:000F  mov  es,di
1340:0011  mov  di,FFFEh
1340:0014  mov  ax,[es:di]
1340:0017  cmp  ax,FFFFh
1340:001A  ret
```

`FFFFh` identifies the original PC-88VA. On that model, `ENGINEIO.SYS`
installs the same original-VA service hooks described in the
[PC-Engine 1.05 analysis](pc88va-boot-pcengine1.05.md#engineiosys-entry-at-13400000).
It also carries the configuration text:

```text
DEVICE=PCENGINE.SYS
DEVICE=ADVGBIOS.SYS
\CONFIG.SYS
```

There is no configuration-time substitution to a separate `PCENGINE.SB2`
file on this disk; the named `PCENGINE.SYS` is already the Sound Board II
driver.

## PCENGINE.SYS Device Header

The portion loaded at `1340:1000` begins with a DOS character-device header:

```text
next device pointer = FFFF:FFFF
attributes          = 8000h
strategy entry      = 0016h
interrupt entry     = 0021h
device name         = "__ENGINE"
```

The complete file is 59,956 bytes. The IPL exposes only its first 3,072 bytes;
the later loader path must load the rest before the Sound Board II routines
described below can execute.

## Sound Board II Evidence

### VA Sound Hardware Ports

The active VAEG implementation models the VA built-in OPN and Sound Board II
at these guest ports:

| Port | Active implementation role |
| ---- | -------------------------- |
| `0044h` | OPN/OPNA primary address and status |
| `0045h` | OPN/OPNA primary data |
| `0046h` | OPNA extended address and status |
| `0047h` | OPNA extended data, including ADPCM |
| `019Ch` | Enable sound-board access wait |
| `019Eh` | Disable sound-board access wait |

The bindings are in [iova/boardsb2.c](../../iova/boardsb2.c). The normal VA
OPN path binds only `0044h/0045h`; the Sound Board II OPNA path additionally
binds `0046h/0047h`, restores six FM channels and rhythm state, and registers
the ADPCM stream. [sound/fmboard.c](../../sound/fmboard.c) selects those paths
as `FMBOARD_VA_OPN` and `FMBOARD_VA_OPNA`.

### Extended OPNA Access In This Driver

This disk's `PCENGINE.SYS` directly reads and writes ports `0046h/0047h`.
The normal PC-Engine 1.05 `PCENGINE.SYS` contains no direct `0046h/0047h`
I/O instructions, while PC-Engine 1.05 `PCENGINE.SB2` and this integrated
driver have the same counts:

| Direct instruction | This `PCENGINE.SYS` | 1.05 `PCENGINE.SB2` | 1.05 normal `PCENGINE.SYS` |
| ------------------ | ------------------: | ------------------: | --------------------------: |
| `IN AL,46h` | 9 | 9 | 0 |
| `OUT 46h,AL` | 7 | 7 | 0 |
| `IN AL,47h` | 3 | 3 | 0 |
| `OUT 47h,AL` | 5 | 5 | 0 |

The main extended-register writer is:

```asm
PCENGINE.SYS:8B6B  cli
PCENGINE.SYS:8B6C  push ax
PCENGINE.SYS:8B6D  mov  al,ah
PCENGINE.SYS:8B6F  out  46h,al
PCENGINE.SYS:8B71  pop  ax
PCENGINE.SYS:8B72  nop
PCENGINE.SYS:8B73  nop
PCENGINE.SYS:8B74  nop
PCENGINE.SYS:8B75  out  47h,al
PCENGINE.SYS:8B77  sti
PCENGINE.SYS:8B78  ret
```

The surrounding routines poll bit 2 of port `0046h`, select extended register
`0Fh`, read data from `0047h`, and program extended registers `02h-0Dh` and
`10h`. These operations are consistent with the OPNA/ADPCM path implemented
by `boardsb2.c`; they are not available through the original VA's three-channel
OPN-only binding.

The relationship to the later PC-Engine 1.05 Sound Board II driver is not
based only on I/O counts. The interval `881Ah-8D07h` in this `PCENGINE.SYS`
is byte-identical to interval `8BCEh-90BBh` in PC-Engine 1.05
`PCENGINE.SB2`: 1,262 identical bytes with SHA-256
`9b9d99d68784b7a14b6338ace57ac616111db5305476a71cda1c89a8f1b0bb37`.
Other large matching blocks and the aligned `0046h/0047h` references show
that the later `.SB2` driver is closely related to this integrated code,
although the complete files are not identical.

### Detection And Service Dispatch

At offset `854Dh`, the driver accepts service numbers in `AH` through `0Ch`,
saves registers, and attempts a primary-port readback:

```asm
cmp  ah,0Ch
ja   return
...
mov  al,FFh
cli
out  44h,al
in   al,45h
sti
dec  al
...
jnz  error_21h
```

This appears to be an availability/readback check before dispatching the
sound service. Static analysis alone does not prove the complete hardware
detection contract, so the exact meaning of the `FFh` readback is left open.

The embedded strings `RHYTHM`, `STATUS`, and `RECORD`, the extended OPNA port
code, and the dedicated `RTHMSAMP.BAS` sample are mutually consistent with
rhythm and recording/ADPCM services. The strings by themselves are not used
as the primary proof; direct `0046h/0047h` I/O is the decisive distinction
from the normal OPN driver.

## Boot Chain

The statically confirmed chain is:

```text
Original-VA ROM boot decision
  -> load C0/H0/R1 at 3000:0000
  -> execute this disk's distinct IPL
  -> initialize work pointers and detect memory
  -> read LBA 11-17 at 1340:0000
  -> execute ENGINEIO.SYS at 1340:0000
  -> install original-VA PC-Engine hooks
  -> expose the integrated Sound Board II PCENGINE.SYS header at 1340:1000
  -> enter ROM-side initialization through F000:940D
  -> later load and execute the remaining PCENGINE.SYS body
  -> provide OPNA extended-register, rhythm, and ADPCM-facing services
```

The Sound Board II support is therefore not implemented by the IPL itself.
The IPL is responsible for memory setup and the first driver transfer; the
Sound Board II-specific implementation resides in the larger integrated
`PCENGINE.SYS`.

## Confirmed And Unresolved Points

### Confirmed By Static Evidence

- The image contains 160 normal 2HD tracks and no stored D88 sector errors.
- The original-VA ROM loads the 1,024-byte IPL at `3000:0000`.
- The IPL reads seven sectors, or `1C00h` bytes, from LBA 11 to `1340:0000`.
- Those sectors contain all of `ENGINEIO.SYS` and the first 3,072 bytes of
  `PCENGINE.SYS`.
- `ENGINEIO.SYS` is the same original-VA integration layer used by PC-Engine
  1.05/1.1.
- This disk has no separate `PCENGINE.SB2`; its `PCENGINE.SYS` directly uses
  OPNA extended ports `0046h/0047h`.
- The extended-I/O instruction counts and a 1,262-byte exact code block match
  the later PC-Engine 1.05 `PCENGINE.SB2` variant.
- The normal PC-Engine 1.05 `PCENGINE.SYS` has no direct `0046h/0047h`
  instructions.
- `ADVGBIOS.SYS` is the Graphics BIOS Ver 1.00 component also found on the
  analyzed PC-Engine 1.00 disk.

### Still Requiring Runtime Trace Or Additional Documentation

- The official PC-Engine version designation for this unnumbered disk.
- The exact contract of the IPL's post-read `INT 80h` calls.
- The exact later path that loads the remainder of `PCENGINE.SYS`.
- The semantic names of all Sound Board II service numbers `00h-0Ch`.
- The precise hardware-detection meaning of the `FFh` primary-port readback.
- Whether this system disk intentionally rejects an original VA without
  Sound Board II or merely returns an unavailable-service error.
- Runtime behavior on VA2/VA3, whose built-in OPNA exposes the same extended
  port class but follows a different model initialization path.

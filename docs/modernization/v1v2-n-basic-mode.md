# PC-8001 (N-BASIC) mode on vaeg

This page describes how vaeg runs PC-8001/PC-8801 N-BASIC in the PC-88VA's
V1/V2 mode, why that needs vaeg extensions, what the VA ROMs do on the way,
and what remains open. Companion documents:
[`v1v2-mode-plan.md`](v1v2-mode-plan.md) (hardware model),
[`v1v2-mode-decisions.md`](v1v2-mode-decisions.md) (decision register, items
C4, C6, C7, C8), task
[`M103h`](../agents/tasks/M103h_v1v2_nbasic.md).

Tags as in the decision register: `[VA-TM]` VA technical manuals, `[ROM]`
VA ROM disassembly or traces, `[X88000]` PC-8801 behaviour as implemented by
X88000 1.5.3, `[MEAS]` real machine, `[DERIVED]` concluded, `[POLICY]`

## 1. Summary

- The PC-88VA has no N-BASIC ROM and no N mode. `[ROM]` The banner
  "NEC PC-8001 BASIC" appears in none of the VA ROM images
  ([`upd9002-upd70008-mode.md`](upd9002-upd70008-mode.md) Appendix C.6).
- `[MEAS]` (maintainer; I/O magazine, November 1987, "88VA plus N-BASIC")
  N-BASIC runs on a real VA when its ROM image is copied to RAM and run in
  all-RAM mode; the published loader patches N-BASIC's port 31h writes so
  that it never leaves all-RAM mode.
- vaeg instead adds the PC-8801's N-mode ROM switch to its 88-mode memory
  map, so N-BASIC and N-88 BASIC run **unmodified**: no ROM byte is patched.
  The N-BASIC ROM is user-supplied and never part of the repository.
- Status: `NEW ON 1` from V1 S N-88 BASIC starts N-BASIC, and the N
  setting boots straight into N-BASIC without a disk on both models
  (implemented, G103h pending).

## 2. Files and settings

| Item | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| N-BASIC ROM | `n80.1.8.rom`, `n80.1.2.rom`, `n80.rom` or `N80.ROM`, 32 KiB, in the ROM directory | Optional; loaded at every reset: the file chosen in the menu (`V1V2_N80ROM`), else the first found in that order. The versioned names are known dumps (below); `n80.rom` is accepted whatever it holds. About shows the loaded file and its identity. |
| Z80 mode | Emulate > Z80 mode: V2 H, V2 S, V1 H, V1 S, and one N (PC-8001) entry per usable N-BASIC ROM file, labelled with its identity | V1/V2 is the VA memory switch B1FC5h bit 0 (backup memory); H/S is `V1V2_Standard` and N is `V1V2_NMode` in the configuration file. N is available only with an N80 ROM. Selecting an entry resets. About shows `Z80 MODE`. |

Known dumps, registered by SHA-1 at the maintainer's request
(`sdl2/n80rom.c`; other files are shown as "unknown dump"):

| Identity | SHA-1 |
|---|---|
| N-BASIC 1.2 | `063609dd518c124a4fc9ba35d1bae35771666a34` |
| N-BASIC 1.8 | `06dae1db384aa29d81c5b6ed587877e7128fcb35` |

A PC-8801 N80 ROM is 32 KiB: N-BASIC at 0000h–5FFFh and the Debug 8800
monitor bank at 6000h–7FFFh. `[ROM]` In the image tested (PC-8001 BASIC
Ver 1.8) the top 8 KiB is byte-identical to the VA's own Debug 8800 bank
(`varom00` offset 1E000h).

## 3. What the hardware and ROMs do

### 3.1 Memory map

- `[VA-TM]` Port 31h (OUT, V1/V2 only): bit 2 RMODE (0 N-88 ROM, 1
  "monitor ROM"), bit 1 MMODE (0 ROM/RAM, 1 all RAM).
- `[X88000]` On a PC-8801, RMODE (the N/N-88 switch) selects the N-BASIC ROM
  at 0000h–7FFFh.
- `[ROM]` On the VA, N-88 BASIC's MON sets RMODE and keeps executing below
  6000h, so the real VA switches only 6000h–7FFFh to Debug 8800 (decision
  M3).
- vaeg (decision C7): with an N80 ROM present, RMODE in 88 mode with MMODE
  clear shows the whole ROM at 0000h–7FFFh; writes go to the RAM below, as
  with the N-88 ROM. Without the file the VA behaviour (M3) is unchanged.
  Because the ROM's top 8 KiB is the same Debug 8800 bank, N-88 BASIC's MON
  behaves the same either way.

### 3.2 `NEW ON 1`

- `[ROM]` N-88 BASIC's `NEW ON` is in extension ROM bank 2 (77A7h). Odd
  arguments call 39C2h, which reads IN 31h and needs bit 7 = 1 (V1) and
  bit 6 = 0 (standard speed); otherwise error 33, "Feature not available".
  On success it builds `OUT (31h),A / JP (HL)` at 847Ah with RMODE set and
  jumps to 0000h, the N-BASIC entry (`DI / LD SP,FFFFh / JP 003Bh`).
- `[VA-TM]` IN 31h reads memory switch B1FC6h: bit 7 MS27 (V1/V2), bit 6
  MS26 "unused, always 1". `[X88000]` On a PC-8801 bit 6 reports high speed.
  So on a real VA `NEW ON 1` always fails.
- vaeg (decision C6): under V1 S, IN 31h clears bit 6 in 88 mode. CPU timing
  is not changed.

### 3.3 V1/V2 and H/S selection

- `[ROM]` The VA2 ROM writes memory switch B1FC5h to port 1C6h at reset
  (F000:12E4); port 150h then reports the mode (active low: FFFEh V1, FFFDh
  V2), and the ROM recomputes MS27 from it (F000:14BC). The original VA's
  ROM reads 150h (F000:0A77) but never writes 1C6h; vaeg starts 150h from
  B1FC5h bit 0 at reset (decision C8, ledger entry).
- `[ROM]` Before that the ROM checks the record's checksum B1FCDh after
  setting B1FC6h bit 7 (F000:23B7). vaeg's checksum had not followed that
  rule, so saved settings were restored to defaults at each boot (ledger
  entry, fixed in M103h).

### 3.4 Text display in standard speed

- In S mode N-88 BASIC disables the fast TVRAM (port 32h TMODE set) and keeps
  its text in main RAM F000h–FFFFh, which the PC-8801's CRTC DMA reads. The
  VA always runs as H and never shows text from there.
- vaeg (decision C6): with TMODE set in 88 mode, the TSP 3301 emulation reads
  the 4 KiB text window from 88-mode main RAM. After `NEW ON 1` port 32h stays
  as N-88 BASIC left it, so N-BASIC's text, written to the same area, is shown
  the same way.

## 4. Starting N-BASIC with `NEW ON 1` (implemented)

1. Put the N80 ROM in the ROM directory; check About (`ROM(N80): exist`).
2. Emulate > Z80 mode > V1 S (resets).
3. Boot V1/V2 N-88 BASIC from a V1/V2 disk (the VA ROM enters V1/V2 only
   from such media on the VA2).
4. Eject the disk from drive 1, then type `NEW ON 1`.

`[ROM]` N-BASIC probes the disk subsystem at start-up and, if drive 1 holds
a disk, reads track 0 sector 1 and runs it. An N-88 system disk's boot code
then takes over (black screen or an apparent reset). With drive 1 empty,
N-BASIC prints "NEC PC-8001 BASIC Ver 1.8" and `Ok`, and runs programs.
`[DERIVED]` A PC-8801 in N mode boots a disk in drive 1 the same way.

`[ROM]` N-BASIC writes code FCh into the text RAM right after the `Ok`
prompt (3C7Dh) and later searches for it to find the start of the input
line (1EADh). In the VA, VA2 and PC-8801 fonts FCh is blank.

selection, IN 31h under H/S, port 150h after reset, the N80 mapping with and
without RMODE/MMODE, About's entries, and 3301 text from main RAM.

## 6. Booting directly in N mode (implemented, decision C9)

On a PC-8801 the N/N-88 switch makes the machine start in N-BASIC without a
disk. vaeg's N setting does the same with the unmodified VA ROMs:

1. **RMODE at hand-off.** RMODE is set right after `romva_initialize` loads
   the ROMs (the I/O reset runs before the N80 ROM is known), so the VA ROM's
   `BRKEM2 90h` hand-off to 1000:0000 starts N-BASIC.
2. **Entering V1/V2 without a disk.** `[ROM]` The original VA falls back to
   V1/V2 after its V3 boot search fails, also with no disk. The VA2 shows
   "insert the correct disk" instead; with port 40h bit 3 reading 1 (the
   original VA's SW7 OFF, "skip the V3 search") it enters V1/V2. vaeg reports
   that bit only in N mode; M103b's withdrawn SW7 setting stays withdrawn.
3. **Text display.** `[ROM]` Both VA ROMs start V1/V2 with port 148h bit 7
   set (text off; shadow at 0040:00E8h, written at F000:14FE on VA2) and
   clear it only when compatible code writes port 53h with bit 0 clear (trap
   handler F000:1D9D on VA2, 1459h on VA). N-88 BASIC writes 53h; N-BASIC,
   written for the PC-8001, never does, while a PC-8801 resets 53h to 0.
   At the first compatible-mode entry vaeg clears bit 7 in both places once,
   the PC-8801 reset state (maintainer-approved option A). No ROM code is
   changed; the shadow address is the same in both ROMs.

Without the N80 ROM the setting has no effect. With a disk in drive 1,
N-BASIC boots it, as on a PC-8801.

Related fixes found with N mode: the original VA's ROM positions the cursor
with TSP CURS, which vaeg now implements (decision X8, ledger), and Copy
screen text reads the 3301 text rows.

## 7. Open items

- Resolved: the maintainer's "\\" after `Ok` is N-BASIC's FCh marker drawn
  with the PC-98 font (`98font.rom`), whose FCh glyph is a backslash. The VA
  font, like the PC-8801 font, has a blank FCh. Reproduced headless with
  that font setting; the maintainer confirmed the mark disappears with the
  VA font. Not a defect.
- The function-key row shows control-code pictures (for example HT and CR);
  the PC-8801 font has the same pictures at 01h–1Fh, so this is likely
  correct, but unconfirmed.
- N80SR (N80 V2: 320×200 colour graphics, its own port use) follows N-BASIC.

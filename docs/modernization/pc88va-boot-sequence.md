# PC-88VA Boot Sequence Notes

## Scope

The original PC-88VA and the VA2 use different ROMs and have different
observable no-media behavior. This document therefore keeps their boot
sequences separate. VA facts are not silently generalized to VA2/VA3, and
VA2 observations are not used to fill gaps in the original-VA sequence.

The VA3 has not been independently analyzed. The active emulator currently
uses the VA2 ROM set and `PCMODEL_VA2` behavior for the VA2/VA3 selection;
that implementation policy is not proof that VA3 firmware behavior is
identical.

Detailed uPD9002 `BRKEM2`, `CALLN`, `RETEM`, and uPD780-compatible-mode
analysis is kept in [upd9002-z80-emulation.md](upd9002-z80-emulation.md).

The ROMs used for the static analysis are identified here so results are not
accidentally attributed to another dump:

| Model | Active filename | SHA-1 | SHA-256 |
| ----- | --------------- | ----- | ------- |
| Original VA | `varom1.rom` | `54536dc03238b4668c8bb76337efade001ec7826` | `a9c4bf7239c44912de421767ae137f5b144d3cb973f6dc947dbce1fe194fd894` |
| VA2/VA3 selection | `varom1_va2.rom` | `dd4f4521bfbb068f15ab3bcdb8d47c7d82b9d1d4` | `ed32a33d19c0a8312791cca4fc39b70cf233c9a9c80f72c778a687ecfbf4f271` |

## Shared Reset Mechanics

Both analyzed ROMs use the same V30 reset-vector mechanism. The active core
selects V30/uPD9002 native execution for VA models and initializes:

```text
CS:IP = F000:FFF0
physical address = FFFF0h
```

Physical `F0000h-FFFFFh` is ROM1. The model-selected ROM is loaded by
[biosva/biosva.c](../../biosva/biosva.c) and read through the ROM1 mapping in
[cpucva/memoryva.c](../../cpucva/memoryva.c). Both analyzed ROMs contain:

```asm
F000:FFF0  EA 00 00 00 F0    jmp F000:0000
```

The first jump at `F000:0000` is model-specific:

```text
Original VA  F000:FFF0 -> F000:0000 -> F000:0A6F
VA2          F000:FFF0 -> F000:0000 -> F000:12B8
```

Only the reset-vector mechanism is shared in the discussion below.

### Documented Decision Flow

Page 12 of the [technical-manual scan](https://archive.org/details/PC88VA/page/12/mode/2up)

                             +-- yes --> Load one IPL sector at 3000:0000

                                          Jump to IPL at 3000:0000
                                            |
                                            v
                                          DOS boot
```

The original-VA ROM confirms the major decisions and identifies their code
locations.

### Reset Entry And Initial V1/V2 State

The original-VA ROM starts its practical reset body with:

```asm
F000:0000  E9 6C 0A    jmp 0A6Fh

0A6F: mov ax,0040h
0A72: mov ds,ax
0A74: mov sp,0000h
```

Before testing the PC key, the ROM performs the common V1/V2-oriented
initialization described by the flowchart:

1. It writes the uPD9002 internal-control table at ROM offset `0930h`.
2. It prepares the two I/O-trap ranges at `FFE0h-FFE7h`.
3. It initializes PIT, PIC, DMAC, and related ports from the table at `0953h`.
4. It configures memory-control state through ports including `0152h` and
   `0155h`.
5. The routine reached through `0BA9h` sends a TSP `SYNC` command before the
   PC-key decision.
6. The routine at `0B51h` prepares the low interrupt-vector table.

The internal-control and trap-range writes are:

```text
FFFE=11 FFFD=07 FFFC=01 FFFB=60 FFFA=88 FFF9=A0
FFF6=08 FFF5=80 FFF4=53
FFF2=08
FFF0=00
FFE7=00 FFE6=6F FFE5=00 FFE4=60
FFE3=00 FFE2=5B FFE1=00 FFE0=50
```

This prepares V1/V2 compatibility, but it does not yet enable trapping at
`FFEFh`; trap enable occurs only on the selected V1/V2 fallback path.

### PC-Key Test

The PC-key decision is direct keyboard-matrix I/O:

```asm
0AEA: call 0B4Ah
0AED: jz   0B36h

0B4A: mov dx,000Dh
0B4D: in  al,dx
0B4E: and al,04h
0B50: ret
```

The active keyboard implementation confirms the matrix meaning. In
[io/serial.c](../../io/serial.c), guest PC-key scancode `5Ah` is converted to
VA code `7Ah`, whose matrix position is port `Dh`, bit 2. Matrix keys are
active-low. Consequently:

```text
port 0Dh bit 2 = 0  -> PC key held -> branch to 0B36h
port 0Dh bit 2 = 1  -> PC key clear -> continue to SW7 decision
```

`keyboard_reset()` preserves the matrix across reset, which is required for
holding PC while resetting the emulated machine.

### PC-Key Setup Path

The held-PC path is:

```asm
0B36: mov byte [2F07h],01h
0B3B: mov al,91h
0B3D: out FFh,al
0B3F: mov ax,3000h
0B42: mov ss,ax
0B44: call 18B0h
0B47: jmp  0209h
```

`18B0h` runs common V3/BIOS initialization. The dispatcher at `0209h` then
far-calls `E000:B800`. The early port `0152h` setup has selected ROM0 bank 2,
so this address maps through [iova/memctrlva.c](../../iova/memctrlva.c) to
`varom00.rom` offset `2B800h`. That location jumps to `E000:C451`, where the
ROM initializes the setup program. Nearby setup data contains entries for
`SW7`, `FDD`, and `ROM` configuration.

This is static ROM confirmation that holding PC enters the original VA V3
setup path; it is not only an inference from the manual diagram.

### SW7 And V3 IPL Search

When PC is not held, the ROM reads SW7 from system port `40h`, bit 3:

```asm
0AEF: in   al,40h
0AF1: and  al,08h
0AF3: jnz  0AF8h
0AF5: call 16A0h
```

The branch and the technical-manual flow together establish active-low switch
semantics:

```text
SW7 ON  -> port 40h bit 3 = 0 -> call 16A0h and search for a V3 IPL
SW7 OFF -> port 40h bit 3 = 1 -> skip the search and use V1/V2
```

The routine at `16A0h` communicates with the FDD subsystem and tests candidate
boot conditions. A successful path reaches `1743h` and does not return to the
caller. Failure returns to `0AF8h`, the same V1/V2 fallback used when SW7 is
off.

The exact on-disk V3-IPL signature is not decoded yet. The routine is located,
but the meaning of all FDD-subsystem commands and candidate values still needs
to be matched against the subsystem protocol.

### V3 IPL Load And Entry

The successful original-VA V3 path is explicit:

```asm
1748: mov cx,0200h
174F: shr dl,1
1751: jnc 175Ah
1753: shl cx,1
175A: mov ax,3000h
175D: mov es,ax
175F: xor di,di
1761: call 1771h
1764: mov ax,3000h
1767: mov ss,ax
1769: call 18B0h
176C: jmp  3000h:0000h
```

The ROM normally prepares a `0200h`-byte transfer and can double it to
`0400h` according to the detected sector form. It therefore loads one 512-
or 1024-byte IPL sector at physical address `30000h`, performs common V3/BIOS
initialization, and enters it at `3000:0000`.

The ROM does not execute `mov sp,FFFEh`. It set `SP=0000h` at `0A74h`, changes
only `SS` before the common initializer, and reaches the far jump with balanced
calls. Thus the IPL entry state is effectively:

```text
CS:IP = 3000:0000
SS:SP = 3000:0000
first PUSH uses 3000:FFFE
```

The manual's stack indication near `3000:FFFE` describes the first occupied
stack location rather than a literal `SP=FFFEh` assignment.

### V1/V2 Fallback

SW7 OFF and unsuccessful V3-IPL search both converge at `0AF8h`:

```text
0AF8  configure the display/TSP path for V1/V2
0AFB  call 0FCCh -> write 03h to FFEFh and enable I/O traps
0AFE  call 0EE7h -> issue TSP command 12h (DSPON)
0B15  execute BRKEM2 90h
```

This confirms the manual's separation between display-processor setup and
uPD9002 I/O-trap enable. They are adjacent boot operations, but they are not
one hardware block. `BRKEM2 90h` then transfers the main uPD9002 into its
uPD780/Z80-compatible execution mode. It must not be routed to the separate
FDD subsystem Z80.

### Original-VA Emulator Gap: SW7

The active [iova/sysportva.c](../../iova/sysportva.c) labels port `40h` bit 3
as SW7, but `sysp_i040()` does not currently include a configurable bit 3 in
its return value. The emulated bit is therefore always zero, which is the
original-VA SW7 ON state. The ROM always attempts V3 IPL detection and falls
back to V1/V2 only after that attempt fails.

This does not prevent fallback, but it means an explicit original-VA SW7 OFF
configuration cannot currently be represented. The old PC-98-oriented
`np2cfg.dipsw` fields must not be connected to this VA switch without a
separate configuration decision and tests.

### Original-VA Remaining Unknowns

- Exact V3 IPL recognition bytes and checks performed by the FDD subsystem.
- Exact meaning of every uPD9002 internal-control register written before the
  PC-key decision.
- Cycle-accurate timing of the PC-key sampling point and FDD retry loop.
- Behavior of an original VA fitted with the VA-91 upgrade board.

## PC-88VA2 / PC-88VA3

### Scope And Confidence Boundary

This section is a partial VA2 ROM trace. It does not claim a complete VA2 boot
algorithm. The VA3 has not been independently traced, and is mentioned only
because the current frontend exposes a combined VA2/VA3 model selection.

In particular, the original-VA `16A0h` IPL routine, `3000:0000` load details,
and V1/V2 fallback behavior must not be copied into the VA2/VA3 model without
VA2-specific evidence.

### VA2 Reset Entry

The VA2 ROM starts with:

```asm
F000:0000  E9 B5 12    jmp 12B8h
```

The body at `12B8h` sets `DS=0040h`, clears `SP`, and begins display, memory,
backup-RAM, uPD9002, and peripheral initialization.

### VA2 Early Device Initialization

The VA2 ROM performs these statically visible operations:

- Sends an initial parameter block through TSP ports `0142h` and `0146h`.
- Accesses ROM-bank control port `0152h` and backup-memory write control
  `019Ah`.
- Reads backup-memory/memory-switch state near `B000:1FC0`.
- Writes mode-switch state through `01C6h`.
- Emits the uPD9002 internal-control and I/O-trap range table at ROM offset
  `0F20h`.
- Initializes PIT, PIC, and DMAC ports from the table at `0F43h`.

The high internal-control writes are:

```text
FFFE=11 FFFD=07 FFFC=01 FFFB=60 FFFA=88 FFF9=A0
FFF6=08 FFF5=80 FFF4=53
FFF2=08
FFF0=00
FFE7=00 FFE6=6F FFE5=00 FFE4=60
FFE3=00 FFE2=5B FFE1=00 FFE0=50
```

These values match the VA2-specific settings summarized from the local
technical notes in
[upd9002-z80-emulation.md](upd9002-z80-emulation.md). A complete public
uPD9002 register manual has not been located. Public V40/V50 documentation is
only a family analogy for the integrated DMA, interrupt, timer, serial, and
wait-control model.

### VA2 PC-Key And SW7 Neighborhood

The VA2 ROM installs vectors, then reaches this decision neighborhood:

```asm
1364: call 13EDh       ; install vectors
1367: call 13E6h       ; read port 000Dh, mask bit 2
136A: jz   13D2h
136C: in   al,40h
136E: and  al,08h
1370: jnz  1375h
1372: call 1F90h
```

The port `0Dh` test uses the same active-low keyboard-matrix PC-key bit as the
original VA. The structural similarity makes `1F90h` a VA2 boot-media probe
candidate, but that routine has not been decoded to the same standard as the
original-VA `16A0h` path. Its media test, success destination, and failure
behavior remain open.

The `13D2h` PC-held branch sets a setup-path work flag, writes `91h` to port
`FFh`, and enters shared later initialization instead of executing the nearby
`BRKEM2 90h`. The final VA2 setup UI target has not yet been traced end to end.

### VA2 BRKEM2 Handoff

The VA2 ROM override table at `0F5Eh` installs these relevant vectors:

```text
7C -> F000:1944
7D -> F000:1944
7E -> F000:1920
90 -> 1000:0000
91 -> F000:24B0
95 -> 1000:E000
```

On the non-PC branch, the ROM can enable I/O traps and reaches:

```asm
13A8: mov ax,1000h
13AB: mov ds,ax
13AD: xor ax,ax
13AF: mov es,ax
13B1: 0F FE 90       ; BRKEM2 90h
13B4: cli            ; expected native return address
```

The vector setup and instruction boundary make the opcode identity high
confidence. By the documented uPD9002 model transition and V30 analogy, the
working interpretation is that `BRKEM2 90h` enters main-CPU uPD780-compatible
code at `1000:0000` and saves `13B4h` as the native return address.

The exact saved frame, mode-latch protection, interrupt interaction, prefetch
behavior, and cycle timing remain unverified. See
[upd9002-z80-emulation.md](upd9002-z80-emulation.md) for the detailed boundary.

### VA2 Native Resume And Later Initialization

The bytes after `BRKEM2` form coherent V30 code:

```asm
13B4: cli
13B5: call 18EEh      ; disable I/O traps through FFEFh
13BD: mov dx,0152h
13C0: in  ax,dx
13C1: or  ax,4000h
13C4: out dx,ax
13CD: jmp 1000h:C003h
```

The shared initializer configures PIC and DMAC state, installs BIOS/service
vectors, clears low work memory, checks backup memory, sends TSP commands,
and calls BIOS interrupts and ROM services. The target `1000:C003` is physical
`1C003h`, not ROM1 offset `C003h`.

The technical manual confirms `RETEM` as `ED FD` and describes
`1000:C003` as the destination after V1/V2-to-V3 initialization. However, the
VA2-compatible-mode code that prepares this RAM target and executes the return
has not yet been located in a runtime trace.

### VA2 Display And No-Media Behavior

The VA2 ROM writes mode-switch and system-port state through `01C6h`, `01CDh`,
and `01CFh`; the emulator derives V1/V2/V3 LEDs from this state. A plain ASCII
`V2S` string has not been found in `varom1_va2.rom`, so the exact drawing
routine remains unidentified.

Maintainer observation reports that VA2/VA3-class machines stop at a prompt
equivalent to "insert a system disk" when no suitable disk is present. This is
not the original VA's documented V1/V2 fallback. The exact VA2 ROM branch that
draws and waits at that prompt has not yet been traced.

### VA2/VA3 Remaining Unknowns

- Full semantics and success path of the VA2 routine at `1F90h`.
- Exact VA2 V3-IPL recognition algorithm and load address.
- Complete PC-held setup path after the `13D2h` branch.
- Exact no-media prompt routine and wait loop.
- Runtime producer of RAM code at `1000:C003`.
- Main-CPU uPD780-compatible-mode execution and precise mode transitions.
- Any VA3-specific firmware, device, or no-media differences.

## Cross-Model Comparison

| Topic | Original VA | VA2 | VA3 |
| ----- | ----------- | --- | --- |
| ROM1 active filename | `varom1.rom` | `varom1_va2.rom` | Currently shares VA2 file in vaeg |
| First reset body | `F000:0A6F` | `F000:12B8` | Not independently traced |
| PC-key matrix test | Port `0Dh`, bit 2, active-low; confirmed | Same port/bit visible; confirmed | Unknown |
| PC-held setup target | `E000:B800` -> ROM0 bank 2 setup code; confirmed | Branch visible, final UI target unresolved | Unknown |
| SW7 read | Port `40h`, bit 3, active-low; confirmed with manual | Same read visible; downstream behavior incomplete | Unknown |
| V3 media probe | `16A0h`; success/failure control flow traced | `1F90h` candidate; incomplete | Unknown |
| V3 IPL load | One 512/1024-byte sector to `3000:0000`; confirmed | Unknown | Unknown |
| No V3 IPL | Falls back to V1/V2 | Hardware observation: system-disk prompt | Hardware observation: system-disk prompt |
| Compatible-mode entry | `BRKEM2 90h` at `0B15h` | `BRKEM2 90h` at `13B1h` | Unknown |
| Later V3 target | Setup path is known; normal return path still partly open | `1000:C003` visible after native resume | Unknown |

## Model Identification

VA software can distinguish the model using the word at `F000:FFFE`:

```text
FFFFh  original PC-88VA
FFFEh  PC-88VA2 or PC-88VA3
FFFDh  original PC-88VA with the PC-88VA-91 version-up board
```

This is why model-specific ROM paths and hardware behavior must remain
separate even when the emulator exposes a combined VA2/VA3 selection.

## Confidence Summary

| Item | Confidence | Basis |
| ---- | ---------- | ----- |
| Shared reset vector | High | Direct bytes in both identified ROMs and active memory mapping. |
| Original-VA PC-key branch | High | Direct ROM I/O test plus active-low keyboard-matrix mapping. |
| Original-VA setup entry | High | Direct branch, ROM-bank mapping, setup entry code, and nearby setup data. |
| Original-VA SW7 polarity and decision | High | ROM branch agrees with the technical-manual flowchart. |
| Original-VA IPL load and entry | High | Direct transfer loop, segment setup, and far jump. |
| Original-VA IPL signature | Low | Routine located, FDD command semantics not fully decoded. |
| VA2 early initialization | High | Direct ROM and I/O-port observations. |
| VA2 `BRKEM2 90h` identity | High | Vector setup and valid instruction boundary. |
| VA2 media probe and IPL entry | Low | Candidate routine located only by control-flow position; not fully decoded. |
| VA2 no-media prompt | Medium as observed behavior; low for ROM location | Maintainer observation without an identified drawing/wait routine. |
| VA3 sequence | Low | No independent ROM or runtime trace. |

## Emulator Work Suggested By This Analysis

1. Add a VA-specific SW7 representation and return it from port `40h` bit 3
   without reusing PC-98 DIP semantics blindly.
2. Add ROM-less tests for PC-key active-low matrix behavior across reset.
3. Decode the original-VA FDD command sequence enough to identify the V3 IPL
   signature.
4. Trace VA2 routine `1F90h` before implementing a VA2 media decision from
   analogy.
5. Keep VA and VA2/VA3 boot-policy code paths explicit; do not hide unknown
   VA2/VA3 behavior behind the now-understood original-VA path.

# Legacy Z80 contract and M34 evidence

This report describes current HEAD at M34's starting commit
`c8f92d278adaa604ee1c02fa7361cdcc6fa25bd6`. It separates verified source facts
from future hypotheses. Line references apply to that commit.

## Provenance, build, and consumers

`cpucva/types.h:1-5`, `z80.h:5-12`, `z80c.h:5-10`, `z80diag.h:5-10`, and the
corresponding implementations identify M88/cisc origins. A provenance search
outside the frozen tier found exactly the seven files approved in ADR-0011.
`CMakeLists.txt:263-281` puts `z80c.cpp`, `z80diag.cpp`, and
`iova/subsystem.cpp` in `VAEG_VA_SOURCES`; Ninja's compiler dependency output
shows that `subsystem.cpp` directly includes `z80if.h` and `z80c.h`, with
`types.h`, `z80.h`, and `z80diag.h` transitively included. The three objects
are members of the production `libvaeg_va.a` archive.

| Legacy file | Direct active dependency | Transitive production reach | Replacement |
|---|---|---|---|
| `types.h` | `z80.h`, `z80if.h`, `z80c.h`, `z80diag.h` | all three compiled Z80/subsystem objects | fixed-width definitions in M37; delete M41 |
| `z80.h` | `z80c.h` | `z80c.cpp`, test fixture, and `subsystem.cpp` through `z80c.h` | `z80_registers.h` in M37; delete M41 |
| `z80if.h` | `z80c.h`, `z80diag.h`, `z80diag.cpp`, and `subsystem.cpp` | Z80, disassembly, and subsystem objects | `z80_bus.h` in M37/M39; delete M41 |
| `z80c.h` | `z80c.cpp`, `subsystem.cpp`, and M34 test fixture | subsystem ownership, execution, state, and disassembly bridge | `z80_core.h` in M37/M39; delete M41 |
| `z80c.cpp` | CMake production and M34 test source lists | `libvaeg_va.a` and contract test | `z80_core.cpp` in M37/M39; delete M41 |
| `z80diag.h` | `z80c.h` and `z80diag.cpp` | `Z80C` ownership and subsystem bridge | `z80_disasm.h` in M40; delete M41 |
| `z80diag.cpp` | CMake production and M34 test source lists | `libvaeg_va.a` and contract test | `z80_disasm.cpp` in M40; delete M41 |

| Definition | Active definition/consumer evidence | Required replacement | Milestone |
|---|---|---|---|
| aliases in `types.h` | Defined at `cpucva/types.h:15-37`; all legacy headers use them; no independent active include | fixed-width standard types, no catch-all alias header | M37/M41 |
| `Z80Reg` | `z80.h:26-85`; held by `Z80C`; returned by bridge at `subsystem.cpp:349-351` | independently authored mirror, retaining fields consumers need | M37/M40 |
| four bus/clock interfaces | `z80if.h:29-62`; implemented only by `Clock`, `ClockCounter`, and `Subsystem` at `subsystem.cpp:34-121` | independently authored same-semantic contracts | M37/M39 |
| `Z80C` | public surface `z80c.h:81-110`; owned and initialized at `subsystem.cpp:105,128-145` | source-compatible class and used methods | M37/M39 |
| `Z80Diag` | `z80diag.h`; owned by `Z80C`; active bridge calls it at `subsystem.cpp:353-355` | temporary bridge, then independent disassembler | M40 |
| save hooks | bridge `subsystem.cpp:357-367`; consumer `statsave.c:1273-1302` | same C-facing section operations | M37/M39 |
| disassembly hook | declaration `subsystem.h:26`, definition `subsystem.cpp:353-355`; no active caller found | reauthor hook before legacy deletion | M40 |

Repository-wide active searches found these used `Z80C` methods: constructor,
destructor, `Init`, `Exec`, `Reset`, `IRQ`, `Wait`, `GetStatusSize`,
`SaveStatus`, `LoadStatus`, `GetReg`, and `GetDiag`. `GetPC`, `SetPC`, and
`TestIntr` are called only inside the legacy implementation. No active caller
was found for `NMI`, `GetWaits`, `IsIntr`, `EnableDump`, `GetDumpState`, or
`GetStatistics`. `GetPC`, `SetPC`, and NMI remain in the approved architectural
contract; `TestIntr` becomes private and unused diagnostics may be removed.
The only consumers of the C register/disassembly bridges found outside the
frozen tier are their definitions; frozen Win9x debugger users do not impose
an active build contract.

| Public method | Current active use | Replacement decision |
|---|---|---|
| `Z80C`, `~Z80C` | allocated/deleted by `Subsystem` | preserve |
| `Init` | `Subsystem::Initialize` | preserve exact used signature |
| `Exec` | `Subsystem::Exec` | preserve exact used signature |
| `Reset` | `Subsystem::Reset` | preserve exact used signature |
| `IRQ` | `Subsystem::IRQ` | preserve exact used signature and level semantics |
| `NMI` | no external caller | retain architectural service |
| `Wait` | sleep and ATN wake paths | preserve exact used signature |
| `GetStatusSize`, `SaveStatus`, `LoadStatus` | statsave C bridge | preserve exact used signatures; implement explicit codec |
| `GetPC`, `SetPC` | legacy implementation only | retain live-PC architectural service |
| `GetReg` | sleep checks, traces, C bridge | preserve exact used signature and mirror freshness |
| `GetDiag` | subsystem disassembly bridge | retain through M40, then remove with migrated bridge |
| `TestIntr` | legacy implementation only | make internal; no public replacement |
| `GetWaits`, `IsIntr` | no caller | remove after legacy cutover |
| `EnableDump`, `GetDumpState`, `GetStatistics` | no caller | remove after legacy cutover |

## Verified legacy execution behavior

These are implementation facts, not claims that every behavior is
architecturally correct.

- `Exec()` reads `now`, adds unsigned `now-lastclock` to the clock counter,
  drains positive credit during external WAIT or retires instructions while
  credit is positive, refreshes `reg.pc` only on the executing branch, and
  stores `lastclock` (`z80c.cpp:195-216`). `ClockCounter::past()` subtracts
  instruction clocks times the positive machine multiplier
  (`subsystem.cpp:44-70,153-155`). Thus normal execution and WAIT return at
  zero or a negative overshoot, never positive, under current configuration.
- WAIT is bit 1 (`z80c.cpp:163-169`); HALT is bit 0
  (`z80c.cpp:995-1005`). Legacy HALT rewinds PC to the opcode, drains the
  remaining slice if IRQ is absent, and wakes at accepted IRQ by clearing
  wait and incrementing PC (`z80c.cpp:362-366`). Architectural Z80 state is
  halted after HALT with its next-instruction PC; the wrapper therefore needs
  explicit representation translation.
- `IRQ(uint,uint d)` simply stores `d` (`z80c.h:88-91`). Acceptance requires
  both IFF1 and nonzero `intr`, clears IFF1/IFF2, and does not clear `intr`
  (`z80c.cpp:355-390`): vaeg observes a level-sensitive line.
- The configured acknowledge port is read at `z80c.cpp:368`, after acceptance
  is established. IM0 dispatches the returned byte through `SingleStep`
  (`:372-375`); IM1 ignores it and enters `0x38` (`:377-381`); IM2 uses it as
  vector low byte (`:383-386`). `subsystem.cpp:144-157` configures virtual
  port `0x102` and default byte `0x7f`; port `0xf0` can set any eight-bit byte
  (`subsystem.cpp:270-276`), and the virtual port returns it (`:257-262`). No
  current-HEAD runtime trace proves which values reach actual IM0 acceptance.
- DI clears both IFFs (`z80c.cpp:973-976`). EI fetches the following opcode;
  except for DI/EI, it executes that instruction inside the EI handler, then
  enables IFF and tests IRQ (`:978-989`). For following DI/EI it rewinds and
  returns with IFF disabled. This fuses two architectural instructions into
  one legacy scheduling step and is not automatically a replacement contract.
- NMI is synchronous: it copies IFF1 to IFF2, clears IFF1, pushes live PC,
  charges 11 clocks, and jumps to `0x66` (`z80c.cpp:343-350`). No active
  external caller or pending NMI path was found.
- Memory helpers mask addresses to 16 bits and wrap word accesses
  (`z80c.cpp:230-254`). Common I/O helpers mask every external port to eight
  bits (`:256-263`); all scalar and block I/O instructions use those helpers.
- `inst` is authoritative live PC (`z80c.h:132-134,219-222`). `reg.pc` is the
  public mirror synchronized after the execution loop (`z80c.cpp:208-213`).
  I/O callbacks therefore see the previous return boundary through `GetReg()`.
- Reset zeroes `reg` and `uf` but never initializes `xf`
  (`z80c.cpp:317-338`). `GetAF()` merges `xf` bits 3 and 5 into F
  (`:430-435`), and save serializes `xf` (`:1977-1988`). This is demonstrated
  undefined legacy state, not behavior to reproduce.
- Status revision is 1 and fields are declared at `z80c.h:113-128`.
  `SaveStatus()` materializes AF, copies registers, overrides the mirror PC
  with live PC, and writes IRQ, WAIT/HALT, `xf`, remaining clock, and last
  clock (`z80c.cpp:1972-1991`). Load checks revision and restores those fields
  (`:1993-2006`). The C load bridge discards the Boolean result
  (`subsystem.cpp:365-367`), a robustness risk outside M34 behavior changes.

Architectural behavior to preserve comprises registers/flags, documented EI
inhibition, IM behavior, HALT, NMI, address wrapping, and instruction effects.
Externally observed vaeg behavior additionally comprises acceptance-time
acknowledge, level IRQ, eight-bit ports, clock debt, external WAIT, stale
callback-time public mirror, and revision-1 frame-boundary state. Legacy EI
fusion, uninitialized `xf`, public `TestIntr`, and diagnostic internals are old
implementation details or defects and are not automatically preserved.

## Production save boundary

The only active production `statsave_save` caller is the GUI state menu at
`sdl2/gui/gui.cpp:2352-2373`. The frame driver calls `pccore_exec()` and waits
for it to return before `gui_draw()` (`sdl2/np2.c:1192-1205`); `gui_draw()`
opens the state menu (`gui.cpp:2590-2616`). During `pccore_exec()`, each VA
slice calls `subsystemmx_exec()` (`pccore.c:1078-1217`), which calls the C
bridge and then `Z80C::Exec()` (`iova/subsystemmx.c:48-53` and
`subsystem.cpp:341-343`). All calls are synchronous on this path.

The save path is:

```text
run_guest_frame()
  -> pccore_exec() returns
  -> gui_draw()
  -> draw_state_menu()
  -> statsave_save()
  -> STATFLAG_SUBCPU (`statsave.tbl:195`)
  -> flagsave_subsystemcpu()
  -> subsystem_savecpustatus()
  -> Z80C::SaveStatus()
```

`statsave.c:1327-1417` drives the section table;
`statsave.c:1273-1287` allocates the exact Z80-reported size and invokes the
bridge. Consequently `Exec()` and every synchronous Z80 callback have returned
and the CPU is at the completed instruction boundary established by the loop.
No instruction-, prefix-, bus-, or callback-internal microstate is reachable
at this save point. `lastclock`, live PC, and materialized flags are confirmed
above. The documentary claim that remaining credit may be positive is
disproved for production `Exec()`; zero and negative debt are reachable.

## Revision-1 ABI and retained fixtures

`tests/z80/legacy_contract.cpp` is a ROM-less, test-only probe. It uses
hand-assembled instructions, exercises save/load at returned execution
boundaries, and embeds the expected bytes so drift fails CTest. It first
executes `XOR A` to avoid depending on uninitialized `xf`.

Native GCC and Clang on little-endian x86_64 report the same layout:

| Item | Size/offsets in bytes |
|---|---|
| primitives | `bool=1`, `uint=4`, `sint32=4`, `uint8=1`, `uint16=2`, `uint32=4`, pointer `=8` |
| `Z80Reg::wordreg`, `Z80Reg`, `Status` | `4`, `56`, `68` |
| main words | AF `0`, HL `4`, DE `8`, BC `12`, IX `16`, IY `20`, SP `24` |
| main bytes | F/A `0/1`, L/H `4/5`, E/D `8/9`, C/B `12/13`, XL/XH `16/17`, YL/YH `20/21`, SPL/SPH `24/25` |
| alternate/PC | AF' `28`, HL' `32`, DE' `36`, BC' `40`, PC `44` |
| control | I `48`, R-low `49`, R7 `50`, IM `51`, IFF1 `52`, IFF2 `53` |
| status tail | IRQ `56`, WAIT `57`, `xf` `58`, revision `59`, remaining `60`, last `64` |

The GCC report SHA-256 is
`6acc21e65a13da252e426657fa067ae732001183710bb1cd2bd9cc1c569fa5f9`;
the Clang report differs only in compiler text and hashes to
`bd6cd8822072abc8912ac48cfa2d0772be816f878bfbed8346792129b5578501`.
The MinGW x86_64 test executable and Clang layout-only probes for
x86_64-w64-windows-gnu, arm64-apple-macos11, and aarch64-linux satisfy the
same compile-time sizes. They were not executed locally; supported-platform
CI execution remains required.

The 15 retained byte fixtures cover ordinary/main and alternate registers,
IM0/1/2 with IFF enabled, IFF2-only after NMI, HALT, external WAIT, IRQ
asserted only after `Exec()` returns, negative remaining debt, nonzero last
clock, EI/NOP, EI/NOP with accepted IRQ, EI/DI, and EI/EI. The test performs
immediate byte-identical load/save for all and continuation comparisons for
all EI shapes, including memory/I/O traces and exactly one acknowledge at
acceptance. Exact 68-byte hex images live in the test source as executable
fixtures rather than duplicated prose.

Positive `remainclock` is absent from every reachable fixture. M37 should
nevertheless decode/encode a synthetic positive revision-1 value unchanged to
make the explicit codec total over the signed field; that is defensive format
coverage, not a claim of production reachability.

## SLEEP_HACK and private G39 procedure

The port-FE callback runs `SleepCheck_VA()` and `SleepCheck_Sorcerian()`
(`subsystem.cpp:205-255`). They compare stale mirror PC with `0x1732` and
`0x700e`, then set external WAIT. ATN bit 7 clears WAIT through the 8255 bridge
(`:313-325`). Do not alter the constants to compensate for a live-PC wrapper.

At G39, in a private-ROM build, enable a bounded debug trace containing slice-
entry live/mirror PC, port-FE mirror PC, WAIT transitions, ATN, and accepted
IM0 acknowledge bytes only. Verify VA subsystem idle reaches WAIT, Sorcerian
idle reaches WAIT, ATN/8255 releases WAIT, and normal FDD operation resumes.
Keep logs and ROM/disk data outside the repository.

## Candidate feasibility facts

The selected `z80.hpp` public `Register` exposes architectural registers,
I/R, IFF/IM, HALT, `consumeClockCounter`, and `execEI`. The execute loop can
return with `execEI` set after EI, so the revision-1 mapping decision in
ADR-0011 is required. Current interrupt code clears the upstream IRQ latch,
has no acknowledge callback, and handles IM0 through `RST` rather than raw
decode. Its normal opcode tables already provide the injection point needed
for a small extension. Dynamic debug decoding is not a public side-effect-free
API.

## Contradictions and hypotheses

Verified contradictions:

1. `M34_z80_migration_contract.md:370` and
   `z80_migration_master.md:292-294` say a post-`Exec()` balance can be
   positive, zero, or negative. Current `Exec()` and WAIT loops plus the
   positive multiplier prove the returned value is non-positive. Preserve
   zero/negative production state; do not redesign scheduling.
2. `z80_migration_master.md:25-27,572-574` says M33 is already represented in
   the roadmap. Current `ROADMAP.md` ends at M32, although M33 commits are in
   history. M34 does not alter or recreate M33.

Unverified hypotheses and future evidence needs:

- Private subsystem software probably accepts the reset `0x7f` in IM0, but
  only acceptance-time G39 tracing can prove it.
- The reserved WAIT bit 2 is sufficient for every reachable new-core EI
  boundary; M37 fixture/continuation tests must prove it on all build families.
- Normal decoder injection makes all raw prefixes maintainable; M35 upstream
  tests, not inspection alone, must prove cycles, R updates, and operand order.
- Preserving mirror refresh at `Exec()` return should preserve both sleep
  hacks; private G39 testing remains decisive.

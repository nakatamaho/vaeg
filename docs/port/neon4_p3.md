# NEON RELAY 4 P3 VA skeleton

P2 was approved with `GO WITH RESTRICTIONS`.  This milestone adds only the
320x200 skeleton; it does not connect the eight NEON4 scenes, 640x200, OPNA,
or BITBLT.

## Stages

`demos/neon4/src/neon4_p3.asm` is built with `NEON4_STAGE=1..6`:

| Stage | Exercise |
|---|---|
| N4-1 | Flat entry, stack, segment setup, and loader return; no video call. |
| N4-2 | VA 320x200 entry followed by a CPU RGB332 solid clear. |
| N4-3 | CPU-written 32-column direct RGB332 bar pattern. |
| N4-4 | TSP VB polling and a per-VB marker-band update until `ESC`. |
| N4-5 | SGP `SET_WORK` + `SET_COLOR` + `CLS` + `END` clear. |
| N4-6 | CPU page-A clear, SGP page-B clear, FB0 DSA page exchange at VB. |

The payload uses the VA keyboard BIOS for `ESC` and the validated loader return
continuation.  It does not use DOS `INT 21h`.

## 8bpp mode contract

The BNN VA BIOS description specifies `CL`/`CH` as the pixel-size fields of
`INT 8Fh/AH=00h`; value `8` selects 8 bits per pixel.  P3 therefore enters the
320x200 mode with `CX=0808h`, then defines one 8bpp FB0 descriptor and one
8bpp display window through `$DefBuf`/`$DefWin`:

```text
GRRES = 0012h       ; G0: 320 dots, 8bpp
FB0.FBW = 320       ; bytes per source row
FB0.FBL = 199
FB0.DSH = 200
RGB composition = G0 direct (0008h)
```

The descriptor ABI is documented in the BNN material; actual VA/VA2 execution
remains the human gate.  The optional `NEON4_DIRECT_REGS=1` path retains the
register-level RGB332 setup for comparison, but is no longer the default.

## Build

```sh
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 1 /tmp/N4-1.COM
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 2 /tmp/N4-2.COM
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 3 /tmp/N4-3.COM
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 4 /tmp/N4-4.COM
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 5 /tmp/N4-5.COM
demos/neon4/build_p3.sh 6 /tmp/N4-6.COM
```

The script wraps each raw payload with the existing NEON3 VA loader so the
COMs use the same `3000:0000` entry and loader continuation as the validated
NEON3 gate.  A distribution D88 is a local test artifact and is not part of
this source commit.

## Gate checks

On VAEG or hardware, run each stage from the validation prompt:

1. N4-1 returns without changing the screen.
2. N4-2 is one uniform direct-colour page.
3. N4-3 shows 32 distinct RGB332 bars.
4. N4-4 changes the marker band only after VB edges and exits on `ESC`.
5. N4-5 is pixel-identical to N4-2; this is the first SGP/CPU gate.
6. N4-6 changes from the page-A colour to the page-B colour only after the
   SGP idle poll and VB edge.

VAEG headless guest execution was not available in this checkout because the
model ROM set was incomplete (`vafont` missing).  Therefore N4-2/N4-5 image
equality and FB0 page switching remain `HUMAN_GATE_PENDING`; no hardware timing
or silicon compatibility claim is made here.

## P4 primitive backend

P4 adds a deterministic 320x200 primitive scene to
`demos/neon4/src/neon4_p3.asm`.  It is intentionally a backend gate, not the
NEON4 scene integration: a filled rectangle and four edges plus both diagonals
are rendered after the VA mode setup and the payload waits at the existing
`ESC` continuation.

The CPU and SGP builds share the same physical geometry.  The CPU build is the
reference writer; the SGP build emits `SET_WORK`, `SET_COLOR`, one `CLS` span
per row, six `LINE` commands, and `END`.  The SGP list reserves 4096 words,
while the P4 diagnostic scene uses 661 words (1322 bytes) at its high-water
point.  The 8bpp LINE descriptor uses screen mode `2`, dot `0` or `1` for the
two pixels in a word, and the verified direction bits (`VD=0400h`,
`HD=0800h`).  Odd X addresses are aligned down to the containing even word.

The CPU line reference follows the SGP accumulator/tie convention rather than
an independent Bresenham tie rule.  This makes the two writers compare at the
logical-pixel level while keeping the CPU path verification-only.

Build both variants with:

```sh
demos/neon4/build_p4.sh cpu /tmp/N4P4CPU.COM
demos/neon4/build_p4.sh sgp /tmp/N4P4SGP.COM
```

VAEG validation on the VA2 model reached `3000:0022` (the `ESC` polling loop)
for both payloads.  The rendered BMPs were compared with ImageMagick
`compare -metric AE` and produced `0` differing pixels.  This is emulator
functional evidence only; real VA/VA2 visual acceptance remains a human gate.

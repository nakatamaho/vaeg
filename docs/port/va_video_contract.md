# GLASS ORBIT P1: PC-88VA video, SGP, and OPNA contract

Status: P1 research complete. This document authorizes preparation of P2 only;
it does not authorize a PC-88VA graphics or sound implementation.

## 1. Scope and evidence labels

This is the P1 evidence freeze for the GLASS ORBIT PC-88VA port. It defines
what P2 may rely on, separates current VAEG behavior from hardware statements,
and records every missing fact that must not be filled in by guesswork.

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[VA-TM]` | PC-88VA technical-manual material made available locally by the maintainer. |
| `[VA-TEKU]` | The maintainer-local Users Club `tekumani` material. It is useful but not a substitute for hardware measurement. |
| `[SRC:path:line]` | Current VAEG implementation evidence only. |
| `[DERIVED]` | Arithmetic or layout inference from documented fields. |
| `[PC98-COMP]` | PC-9801 comparison material; never authority for PC-88VA behavior. |
| `[UNKNOWN]` | No sufficient source or hardware evidence. |
| `[HARDWARE_PENDING]` | A question that VAEG execution cannot settle. |

The local PC-98 references added for this investigation were
`PC-9800TechnicalDataBook_BIOS_1992.md`,
`PC-9800TechnicalDataBook_HARDWARE1993.md`, and
`PC-Techknow 98V 安井勉 1986_text.md`. They clarify the original PC-98
environment only. They do not define a PC-88VA port, PC-88VA BIOS call, or
PC-88VA I/O value.

## 2. Source-platform boundary

`GLASS286.ASM` enters PC-98 graphics through `INT 18h`, drives the GRCG, uses
the master-GDC status at `0A0h`, and selects PC-98 display/access pages through
`0A4h` and `0A6h`. It also uses DOS `INT 21h` for its command line, messages,
and keyboard polling. `[PC98-COMP]`

Those calls describe why `VIDEO286.INC` cannot be carried into the VA port.
The added PC-98 BIOS and hardware material was consulted to retain that
separation, not to translate PC-98 port numbers. The VA port instead has four
distinct owners: TSP timing, graphics-control registers, framebuffer
descriptors, and SGP drawing.

## 3. P1 contract by required item

| Item | P1 result | Evidence and restriction |
|---|---|---|
| 1. 640x200, 16-color packed target | Available only in single-plane mode. `0100h` bit 10 and `0152h` bit 12 select single-plane; `0102h` G0 bit 4 selects 640 dots; `0100h` bits 1:0 select 200 lines; `0102h` G0 bits 1:0 value `01b` selects 4 bpp. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.1, §4.4.3]` The manual says the display and drawing single-plane controls should normally agree. A complete V3 enter/leave register sequence is not established here; see section 4. |
| 2. GVRAM placement | The VA has 256 KiB GVRAM. In V3 CPU mapping it occupies `A0000h` through `DFFFFh`; in SGP space it is `200000h` through `23FFFFh`. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.1, §4.4.6]` Current VAEG allocates `grphmem[0x40000]`. `[SRC:memoryva/gvramva.c:16]` |
| 3. Packed 4bpp representation | Single-plane 4bpp uses one nibble per pixel and palette codes 0 through 15. A 640-pixel row is 320 bytes. The manual's word diagram numbers dot positions from the left/MSB, so P2 must keep the high-nibble-first interpretation under a focused P3 pixel test. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.3, §4.4.6]` The 320-byte pitch is `[DERIVED]`; no CPU pixel writer is authorized before GA-2 verifies this on VAEG. |
| 4. Double-buffer capacity | A 640x200 packed-4bpp page is 64,000 bytes (`0xFA00`). One-screen single-plane mode assigns all 256 KiB to G0, so a 640x400 G0 source surface consumes 128,000 bytes and contains two contiguous 640x200 regions. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.3, §4.4.5]` `[DERIVED]` This is a capacity/layout proof only. P3 must verify a visible page exchange. |
| 5. Vertical blank | TSP status port `0142h`, bit 6 (`VB`), identifies the vertical blanking interval. | `[VA-TEKU:2.TXT TSP status-port diagram]` Exact frame rate and safe monitor profile remain `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`; do not use VAEG timing as performance evidence. |
| 6. Palette | Packed 4bpp addresses 16 palette codes. The machine has two banks of 16 palette entries at word ports `0300h`--`031Eh` and `0320h`--`033Eh`; the entries carry RGB component fields. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.5]` P2 may use one 16-entry palette. It must separately specify V3 palette mode and composition, rather than inherit DOS/BIOS state. |
| 7. SGP operation | SGP is usable only in single-plane mode. It executes an even-addressed, word-oriented command table in main RAM, uses a 58-byte work area, and sees GVRAM at SGP `200000h`--`23FFFFh`. `SET_WORK`, `SET_COLOR`, `LINE`, `CLS`, and `END` are documented. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.6]` The command-list maximum length, host/SGP contention rule, and exact real-machine throughput are `[UNKNOWN]` / `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`. |
| 8. Payload entry | The final GLASS P5 loader is a local PC-Engine validation wrapper; it does not establish a silicon-level bare-payload load contract. | `[SRC:demos/glass-orbit/src/glass_orbit_p5_sgp_loader.asm]` `3000:0000` is the tested payload target for this demo only. `[UNKNOWN]` |
| 9. Main RAM, stack, list, and work placement | SGP main-RAM addresses `000000h`--`09FFFFh` correspond to CPU main RAM `00000h`--`9FFFFh`; the work area is normally there. | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.6]` Exact non-overlapping payload, stack, command-list, and work addresses depend on item 8 and are deferred to P2. `[UNKNOWN]` |
| 10. VA2 OPNA | VA2/VA3 Music BIOS supports YM2608 via interrupt `8Bh`; Music BIOS register functions correspond to OPNA port pairs `44h/45h` and `46h/47h`. Direct VA sound documentation requires status polling around register selection/data writes. | `[VA-TEKU:611MUSIC.TXT §6.11]` `[VA-TEKU:5.TXT §5.11]` Current VAEG binds these pairs for OPNA. `[SRC:io/boardsb2.c:201-236]` A bare-payload Music-BIOS dependency versus direct-I/O design is an explicit P2/P6 decision. |

## 4. Video-mode and framebuffer contract

### 4.1 Required ownership and ordering

The manual establishes fields, not a complete GLASS-specific mode-switch
recipe. P2 must therefore use the following dependency order, while marking
any not-yet-documented register value as unresolved rather than inventing it:

1. choose a documented TSP `SYNC` profile and program its command/parameters;
2. set the display and drawing controls consistently to single-plane;
3. select G0 640-dot, 200-line, 4bpp interpretation;
4. define FB0 source geometry and its displayed sub-screen;
5. load the selected 16-entry palette and select its composition path;
6. set the SGP work area once, submit a command list, and poll `0506h` bit 0;
7. wait for TSP `0142h` bit 6 before changing the displayed source window.

Steps 1--5 are a design dependency order, not an assertion that the hardware
requires these exact writes in this exact order. The required global
blank/enable and restoration sequence remains `[UNKNOWN]`.

The existing timing reconstruction records documented 200-line TSP `SYNC`
vectors, but it is explicitly non-authoritative and does not turn VAEG clock
constants into a hardware timing proof. `[SRC:docs/modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md]`

### 4.2 G0 double-buffer layout proposed for P2

P2 may design against this geometry:

| Property | Value | Basis |
|---|---:|---|
| physical display | 640 x 200 | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.1]` |
| source pitch | 320 bytes | `[DERIVED]` `640 / 2` at packed 4bpp |
| source height | 400 lines | `[DERIVED]` two pages |
| source size | 128,000 bytes | `[DERIVED]` `320 * 400` |
| page A source offset | `0x00000` | `[DERIVED]` |
| page B source offset | `0x0FA00` | `[DERIVED]` `320 * 200` |
| SGP page A/B bases | `200000h` / `20FA00h` | `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.6]` plus offsets |

Framebuffer descriptors have 18-bit FSA/DSA byte addresses relative to CPU
`A0000h`, require four-byte alignment, and require
`DSA = FSA + OFX + FBW * OFY`, `FBW > OFX`, and `FBL > OFY`. FB0 can therefore
describe the 320-byte by 400-line source and select either 200-line half by
the matched `OFY`/`DSA` pair. `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.5]`

This does not assert that a raw DSA change alone is a valid flip. P3 GA-6 must
write all coupled fields that the chosen descriptor requires and compare the
two visible pages. The software must not use FB1 as an interchangeable second
buffer: its FSA/FBL/OFX/OFY are restricted by the documented descriptor model.

### 4.3 SGP submission contract

The command table and its 58-byte work area must live in main RAM. Every SGP
address in a descriptor or start register is in SGP address space, not CPU
address space. The table begins on an even address; ports `0500h`--`0503h`
receive its address, `OUT 0506h,1` starts execution, and `IN 0506h` bit 0 is
zero only when the SGP is stopped. An `END` command ends the list. `[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.6]`

For 640x200 packed 4bpp, one complete page is `0x7D00` words. This follows the
manual's 640x400 `CLS` example (`0xFA00` words) by halving the height.
`[VA-TEKU:4.TXT §4.4.6] [DERIVED]`

P2 must serialize CPU star plotting after SGP completion unless an independent
hardware source establishes simultaneous CPU/SGP access to the same page as
safe. Current VAEG's timing constants and contention comments are
implementation behavior, not that evidence. `[SRC:io/sgp.c:363-387]`

## 5. Sound contract for the later P6 milestone

The original GLASS OPNA code is a PC-98 probe/control implementation and is
not portable by renaming its ports. The two evidence-backed alternatives are:

| Route | What is established | What remains open |
|---|---|---|
| Music BIOS, `INT 8Bh` | `AH=00h` initializes Music BIOS and YM2608; `AH=1Dh` adds rhythm initialization; `AH=04h` / `1Eh` provide low/high register access. | Payload queue ownership, interrupt ownership, and whether the bare runtime may depend on this ROM service. |
| Direct OPNA I/O | Low pair `0044h/0045h`; high pair `0046h/0047h` on OPNA. A status/busy poll is required around accesses. | The complete GLASS instrument/timer initialization sequence and its VA2 behavior. |

P6 must choose one route before moving `GLASS_OPNA.INC`. It may not combine
the PC-98 detection/control ports with the VA contract.

## 6. Explicit unknowns carried into P2

| ID | Question | Status |
|---|---|---|
| P1-U1 | Complete, safe V3 enter/leave sequence including blank/enable and restoration. | `[UNKNOWN]` |
| P1-U2 | Bare-payload loader, entry CS:IP, segment registers, stack, and exit/return contract. | `[UNKNOWN]` |
| P1-U3 | Maximum SGP command-list size and behavior on an overlong list. | `[UNKNOWN]` |
| P1-U4 | CPU/SGP same-page contention semantics and the safety of overlap. | `[HARDWARE_PENDING]` |
| P1-U5 | SGP throughput, page-flip latency, and acceptable frame rate on real VA hardware. | `[HARDWARE_PENDING]` |
| P1-U6 | Exact 4bpp nibble write validation on a real VA. | `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`; VAEG GA-2 may test only the emulator path. |
| P1-U7 | Music-BIOS availability and interrupt assumptions in the final bare runtime. | `[UNKNOWN]` |

## 7. P2 inputs and disposition

P2 may now estimate command-list capacity using the documented 640x200
geometry, choose a staged CPU-versus-SGP verification harness, and present the
single outstanding design choice for packed-4bpp span ends. It must not claim
real-machine timing, loader ABI, or shared-page contention behavior.

**P1 disposition: P2 may be prepared. P3 and later implementation remain
blocked until the maintainer approves P1 and P2.**

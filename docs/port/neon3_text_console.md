# NEON text-console ownership

## Root cause

The `DIR A:`, `DIR B:`, `COPY`, and `TIME` row is not a NEON string.  The
NEON payload has no such literals, while `neon_status_clear_rows` explicitly
left the resident system-line rows to the loader/editor environment.  That
made the row visible whenever the TEXT plane was composed above G0.

GLASS did not expose the row because its composition is graphics-only.  NEON
must keep TEXT enabled, so hiding TEXT is not a valid correction.

## GLASS versus NEON

| Operation | GLASS | NEON | Relevance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TEXT composition | graphics-only composition; TEXT is off | `CX=0031h`, TEXT above G0 | NEON must keep text enabled |
| Soft-key guide | invisible with TEXT off | inherited from the caller unless owned | source of the bottom row |
| Text output | none in the graphics path | VA Text BIOS INT 83h | intended overlay must remain |

GLASS's graphics-only composition explains why the stale guide was not visible;
it is not a suitable NEON fix.

## BIOS service

The PC-88VA Text BIOS documents `INT 83h/AH=2Fh` as soft-key display control.
The low field of `AL` selects the number of function-key entries: `0`, `5`,
or `10`; the `SHMD` bit controls shift-state display.  Startup uses
`AH=2Fh, AL=00h` to stop the guide producer while leaving TEXT enabled.  The
BNN manual's OCR has unrelated following text in this section, so the table
and parameter description at
`docs/tekumani/PC88VA_テクニカルマニュアル_BNN.md:38281-38308` are the
authoritative local reference for this call.

VAEG showed that suppressing the producer alone leaves the system-line mode
marker visible.  The documented Screen Editor `INT 94h/AH=01h, AL=FFh` call
therefore follows it to hide the complete system-line display
(`docs/tekumani/PC88VA_テクニカルマニュアル_BNN.md:49790-49829`).  This is
not a TEXT-off operation: it removes only the system-line presentation.  On
exit the pair is restored with `INT 83h/AH=2Fh, AL=0Ah` and
`INT 94h/AH=01h, AL=0Ah`.

## Startup sequence

`neon_text_console_init` runs before VA graphics mode entry:

```text
Text BIOS INT 83h/AH=2Fh AL=00h (stop producer)
Screen Editor INT 94h/AH=01h AL=FFh (hide system line)
VA graphics INT 8Fh ($ScnMode/$DefBuf/$DefWin/$Compose/$ScnDsp)
NEON Text BIOS INT 83h overlay
```

The status-row clearing path covers all 25 main rows after the soft-key
producer and system-line display have been disabled.  No DOS `INT 21h`,
periodic bottom-row erase, or direct hard-coded TVRAM erase is used.

## Exit

The existing VA graphics leave path remains unchanged.  Before returning, the
payload restores the normal ten-entry guide with Text BIOS
`INT 83h/AH=2Fh, AL=0Ah` and Screen Editor `INT 94h/AH=01h, AL=0Ah`.  The
loader/editor then returns with its saved continuation.

## QA status

The source-level checks are:

* TEXT composition remains `CX=0031h` (text above G0), so TEXT is enabled;
* intended NEON strings continue to use `INT 83h`;
* `INT 83h/AH=2Fh` stops the soft-key producer and `INT 94h/AH=01h` hides
  the system-line presentation;
* no DOS `INT 21h` appears in the NEON VA payload;
* graphics SGP/G0 code is unchanged.

The VAEG capture's visible-main TVRAM region (4000 bytes, 80x25 cells) was
checked with `demos/neon3/tools/verify_text_console.py`:

```text
VISIBLE_NONBLANK_BYTES=1082
FORBIDDEN_VISIBLE=NONE
TEXT_VISIBLE=PASS
BOTTOM_GUIDE=PASS
```

The captured backing area may still contain old caller bytes, but `AL=00h`
stops the soft-key producer and the visible 80x25 main plane is clean.  No
destructive TVRAM wipe is required.  The VAEG stale-console check is complete;
a hardware human gate remains required for VA/VA2 cursor, post-return, and
visual graphics behavior.  The human check must verify that intended NEON text
is visible, the `DIR A:`/`COPY`/`TIME` guide is absent, and TEXT remains enabled
above the unchanged graphics.

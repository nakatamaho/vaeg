# NEON RELAY 4 PC-88VA P1 contract

Status: P1 research complete. This document authorizes P2 design work only;
it does not authorize a NEON4 VA implementation.

The first implementation target remains the 286 scene path in `demos/neon4`.
The two requested physical modes are 320x200 and 640x200, both single-plane,
packed 8bpp, with two displayable source pages where the descriptor and real
machine tests permit it. SGP is the drawing engine. PC-98 GRCG, EGC, GDC,
PEGC, DOS services, PC-98 IRQ code, and OPL3 are not part of this contract.

## 1. Evidence labels

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `[VA-TM]` | BNN PC-88VA technical-manual material in this checkout. |
| `[VA-TEKU]` | Maintainer-local Users Club/technical material under `docs/tekumani/`. |
| `[SRC:path:line]` | Current VAEG or existing VA payload source evidence. |
| `[DERIVED]` | Arithmetic or field interpretation derived from documented values. |
| `[IMPLEMENTATION]` | Behaviour implemented by VAEG; not by itself a silicon claim. |
| `[UNKNOWN]` | No sufficient source or measurement is available. |
| `[HARDWARE_PENDING]` | Requires a PC-88VA/VA2 run or electrical measurement. |

The existing `demos/neon3` and `demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite` payloads are the
primary reusable VA examples. Their proven 4bpp details must not be silently
generalized to 8bpp when the descriptor or mode value has not been calibrated.

## 2. Contract summary

| Item | P1 result | Status and restriction |
|---|---|---|
| Color representation | Direct packed RGB332, not a palette index | **Resolved.** One guest byte is `gggrrrbb`: blue is bits 1:0, red bits 4:2, green bits 7:5. No frame palette animation is allowed. `[SRC:vram/scrndrawva.c:21-39,311-420]`, `[SRC:vram/makegrphva.c:398-485]`, `[DERIVED]` |
| 320x200 / 640x200 mode setup | Use VA graphics BIOS/TSP/GRMODE/GRRES/FB descriptors as one transaction | 320x200 4bpp BIOS entry is proven by the sprite payload; 8bpp `CX` values and the complete 640-dot BIOS argument are `[UNKNOWN]` and must be calibrated before P3. `[SRC:demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_m7.asm:360-396]`, `[SRC:docs/modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md:320-358]` |
| GVRAM address and size | SGP GVRAM `200000h-23FFFFh`, 256 KiB; CPU aperture is modelled separately | 320x200x8bpp = 64000 bytes/page; 640x200x8bpp = 128000 bytes/page. Two 640x200 pages consume the complete 256 KiB SGP GVRAM window; page validity remains `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`. `[SRC:docs/modernization/upd92017-sgp.md:370-382]`, `[SRC:memoryva/gvramva.c:1-16]`, `[DERIVED]` |
| Display-source switching | FB0/FB2 descriptors carry FSA/DSA and source geometry | Existing DSA1 exchange in the 4bpp G1 demo proves one VA page-switch pattern, not FB0 8bpp. NEON4 FB0 two-page switching is `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`. `[SRC:demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_m7.asm:260-340]`, `[SRC:docs/modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md:358-455]` |
| VBLANK | TSP status port `0142h`, bit 6 (`VB`) | Port/bit are established by existing payloads and TSP reconstruction; exact hardware cadence for both requested modes is `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`. `[SRC:demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_m7.asm:45-58]`, `[SRC:docs/modernization/upd72022-tsp.md]` |
| Packed byte order | Increasing logical X consumes increasing GVRAM bytes; words are little-endian | In 320-dot host presentation VAEG duplicates each source byte for display scaling; guest storage remains one byte/pixel. `[SRC:vram/makegrphva.c:398-485]`, `[IMPLEMENTATION]` |
| SGP operation | `SET_WORK`, `SET_SOURCE`, `SET_DESTINATION`, `SET_COLOR`, `BITBLT`, `LINE`, `CLS`, `END` | Command-list ports and busy protocol are established. 8bpp descriptor lane/width encodings and real `BITBLT` GVRAM-to-GVRAM behaviour remain `[UNKNOWN]`/`[HARDWARE_PENDING]`. `[SRC:docs/modernization/upd92017-sgp.md:393-455,1065-1105]` |
| OPNA | VA Music BIOS `INT 8Bh`, YM2608 register services | Use the VA BIOS path only. Exact NEON4 score lifecycle and rhythm/SSG requirements are deferred to P8. `[VA-TEKU:611MUSIC.TXT §6.11]`, `[SRC:docs/port/neon3_va_video_contract.md:92]` |
| Payload/RAM/cache | NASM flat `.COM`, existing VA payload entry/return convention, command/work/data in main RAM | SGP main-RAM addresses `000000h-09FFFFh` are available in the documented map. Initial CAT/raster assets stay in main RAM; 640x200x8bpp leaves no unused GVRAM page tail. Exact loader stack reservation is selected in P2/P3. `[SRC:demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_m7.asm:1-20]`, `[SRC:docs/modernization/upd92017-sgp.md:370-382]` |

## 3. Direct RGB332 is the color contract

NEON4 must not carry the original PEGC palette-animation design into the VA
backend. The VAEG direct-color composition path reconstructs an 8-bit pixel as
follows:

```text
pixel byte:  ggg rrr bb
green = (pixel >> 5) & 7
red   = (pixel >> 2) & 7
blue  = pixel & 3
```

`vram/scrndrawva.c` builds the same mapping for all 256 byte values before
compositing a direct 8bpp screen (`pixelmode == 2`). The direct-color branch
does not index `videova.palette`; it converts the byte through `rgb8to16`.
`vram/makegrphva.c:398` reads packed bytes from GVRAM in address order. In the
320-dot host path it duplicates each byte only when expanding the guest image
into the common 640-dot host surface. Therefore the NEON4 guest framebuffer is
one RGB332 byte per logical pixel at both widths.

P2 consequence:

```text
source 256-colour ramp -> RGB332 byte values
frame update            -> write pixel bytes, not VA palette registers
face/ribbon/finale shade -> choose a direct RGB332 value
```

The source 256-colour ramp is still useful as a color-selection table, but it
is not a palette upload. Any code named `palette16_prepare_city_animation`
must be replaced by direct pixel-value generation at the VA abstraction.

## 4. Mode and framebuffer contract

### 4.1 Graphics mode fields

`GRMODE` selects the vertical interpretation (200-line field is `VW=10b` in
the reconstructed register model). `GRRES` is a separate 16-bit register at
`0102h-0103h`:

| Field | Values | NEON4 use |
|---|---|---|
| `PM0` bits 1:0 | `00=1`, `01=4`, `10=8`, `11=16` bpp | Set G0 to `10` for packed 8bpp. |
| `HW0` bit 4 | `0=640`, `1=320` logical dots | Set/clear for the selected build mode. |
| `PM1` bits 9:8 | Same mapping for G1 | Keep G1 disabled or configure only if the presentation design needs it. |
| `HW1` bit 12 | Same width selection for G1 | Do not assume G1 is needed for a G0-only NEON4 image. |

These field positions are documented/reconstructed in
`docs/modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md:320-358`. The complete 8bpp VA
Graphics BIOS call (`INT 8Fh`, function 0) is not present in an existing
payload; the proven `BX=E00Eh`, `CX=0404h` call is specifically the 320x200
two-screen 4bpp case and must not be copied as an 8bpp value.

The TSP `SYNC` vector, graphics enable/disable ordering, and matching
`GRMODE`/`GRRES` writes are one mode transition. The repository records complete
200-line PC-88VA timing vectors, but P1 does not authorize inventing a new
vector or claiming that a 640-dot 8bpp BIOS call has been validated.

### 4.2 Framebuffer descriptor fields

Each framebuffer descriptor is a `20h`-byte block. FB0 is `0200h-021Fh`; FB2
is the second G0 descriptor. The fields used by NEON4 are:

| Offset | Field | Meaning |
|---:|---|---|
| `+00h` | FSA | Virtual framebuffer start, 18-bit aligned address |
| `+04h` | FBW | Source-line pitch, four-byte aligned |
| `+06h` | FBL | Virtual final line / wrap extent in the VAEG model |
| `+08h` | DOT | Source pixel lane |
| `+0Ah` | OFX | Source X offset |
| `+0Ch` | OFY | Source Y offset |
| `+0Eh` | DSA | Displayed source start |
| `+12h` | DSH | Displayed source height |
| `+16h` | DSP | CRT destination Y |

The descriptor offsets and field roles are from
`docs/modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md:358-455` and
`docs/modernization/more-screen-resolutions.md:200-218`. For tightly packed
8bpp data the arithmetic pitches are:

```text
320 dots: 320 bytes/line,  320 * 200 =  64000 bytes/page (0x0FA00)
640 dots: 640 bytes/line,  640 * 200 = 128000 bytes/page (0x1F400)
```

Two 320x200 pages require `0x1F400` bytes. Two 640x200 pages require
`0x3E800` bytes, exactly the `0x40000`-byte single-plane SGP GVRAM window with
`0x1800` bytes unused. This is capacity arithmetic only; the exact FB0/FB2
source-page selection and display timing must be checked on VA and VA2.

### 4.3 CPU and SGP address spaces

The SGP map reconstructed in `upd92017-sgp.md` places main RAM at
`000000h-09FFFFh` and GVRAM at `200000h-23FFFFh`. Existing 4bpp payloads use
the `A000:0000` CPU graphics aperture after the BIOS transition and convert
COM `DS:offset` values to physical addresses for SGP command parameters. The
same conversion pattern is reusable, but the 8bpp mode must independently
confirm its aperture and descriptor base.

## 5. VBLANK and page publication

Existing VA payloads poll:

```text
TSP status: port 0142h
vertical-blank bit: bit 6 (VB)
```

The `VB` bit and port are established by `upd72022-tsp.md` and the SGP sprite
payload. VAEG derives approximately 61.46 Hz for one 200-line timing profile
and approximately 59.95 Hz for another; these are emulator timing results,
not a PC-88VA/VA2 hardware guarantee.

The intended NEON4 presentation sequence is:

```text
render non-displayed source page
wait for SGP idle and finish CPU work
wait for VB edge
switch the validated FB0 display source
```

The existing sprite demo's FB1 DSA exchange (`022Eh`/`0230h`) is evidence for a
working G1-specific pattern only. It does not prove that writing those ports
selects an FB0 8bpp page. P2 must choose and instrument the correct FB0/FB2
descriptor path; no guessed page-flip port is authorized here.

## 6. SGP operation contract

The SGP command list resides in main RAM, is word-addressed/little-endian, and
is submitted through the following interface:

| Port | Use |
|---:|---|
| `0500h` | low word of command-list physical address |
| `0502h` | high word of command-list physical address |
| `0504h` | control/interrupt/abort |
| `0506h` | start and busy status |
| `0508h` | implementation-specific read; do not use as a hardware contract |
| `0580h` | GVRAM bus/readiness and CPU-data write mode (`10h` in existing payloads) |

The safe existing flow is: build a complete list, initialize a stable even
58-byte work area and descriptors, wait idle, write `0500h`/`0502h`, configure
`0504h`, start via `0506h`, and poll busy bit 0. This is documented in
`docs/modernization/upd92017-sgp.md:393-455` and exercised by
`demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_sprite_demo.asm:1168-1230`.

NEON4 may use:

```text
SET_WORK       0003h
SET_SOURCE     0004h
SET_DESTINATION 0005h
SET_COLOR      0006h
BITBLT         0007h
LINE           0009h
CLS            000Ah
END            0001h
```

The repository identifies packed 8bpp as a supported SGP pixel mode and
identifies BITBLT as the replacement for the source EGC VRAM copies. It does
not provide a validated 8bpp `SET_SOURCE`/`SET_DESTINATION` lane encoding or a
real-machine GVRAM-to-GVRAM BITBLT result. Those are P2/P6 test items, not
values to infer from the 4bpp sprite descriptors. SGP maximum list length,
command-count limits, same-page CPU access during execution, and completion
latency are also `[HARDWARE_PENDING]`; VAEG can supply functional command
counts, not hardware timing.

## 7. OPNA boundary

The PC-88VA port uses YM2608 through the VA Music BIOS `INT 8Bh`. The existing
documentation and NEON3 contract identify the low-bank and high-bank register
pairs as `44h/45h` and `46h/47h`; `io/boardsb2.c:201-236` maps those addresses
in VAEG's Sound Board II model. NEON4 must call the BIOS service rather than
emitting PC-98 direct-port candidates from the source tree (`0088h`, `0188h`,
and similar values).

P1 does not decide whether the NEON4 score needs SSG, rhythm, `Initialize2`, or
another timer lifecycle. That is P8. The only P1 invariant is OPNA-only and
clean BIOS-owned shutdown; OPL3 and its runtime switches are excluded.

## 8. Payload, stack, and image-cache boundary

The reusable payload contract is the NASM flat `.COM` route used by the existing
VA demos (`org 100h`, private stack/segment setup, VA BIOS entry, bounded SGP
polling, and the existing loader continuation). P1 does not introduce an
arbitrary bare-payload ABI.

Command lists, the 58-byte SGP work area, geometry scratch, and the CAT/raster
assets should initially live in main RAM. For 320x200x8bpp, two pages leave
main-RAM/GVRAM placement flexibility. For 640x200x8bpp, two pages consume the
entire single-plane GVRAM range, so no GVRAM tail may be reserved for the
source images. P2 must produce an explicit map including stack, command-list
high-water bound, image cache, and loader-reserved addresses before P3 writes
any descriptor.

## 9. P1 disposition and restrictions

**Disposition: GO WITH RESTRICTIONS.**

1. The color path is fixed to direct RGB332 bytes (`gggrrrbb`); no palette
   animation or PEGC palette register writes may be used.
2. The 286 geometry/scenes remain the source of logical coordinates. The VA
   backend owns physical X/Y conversion and packed 8bpp writes.
3. Existing neon3 and pseudo-sprite mode/page examples may be reused only
   where their pixel mode and descriptor match. The proven 4bpp `INT 8Fh`
   arguments are not 8bpp arguments.
4. Exact 8bpp Graphics BIOS arguments, FB0/FB2 two-page display selection, and
   8bpp BITBLT descriptors require P2/P3 calibration and, where applicable,
   real VA/VA2 measurement.
5. BITBLT is the planned replacement for the one EGC VRAM-copy scene, but it
   is not claimed hardware-conformant until its 8bpp descriptors pass a
   minimal test.
6. SGP timing, list-size limits, and CPU/SGP same-page contention are not
   performance inputs from VAEG; record them as `hardware_pending`.
7. OPNA is VA Music BIOS only. OPL3, DOS `INT 21h`, PC-98 IRQ2, GRCG, EGC,
   GDC, and PEGC runtime paths remain out of scope.

P2 may now design the 320x200 CPU/SGP control path, direct RGB332 ramp mapping,
command-count measurement, and the first mode-calibration payload. No P3 code
generation is implied by this report.

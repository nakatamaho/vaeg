# M7-0 SGP pseudo-sprite audit

## Scope

This audit precedes the M7 guest optimizations. It records the behavior that
is present in VAEG at the audit baseline; it does not change the SGP timing
model or any existing demo.

## Demo inventory and baseline

There is no stage-7 demo in the current tree. The existing runnable stages are
generated from [`sgp_sprite_demo.asm`](../tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/sgp_sprite_demo.asm):

| Baseline | Source | Generated file | Rendering path |
|---|---|---|---|
| M5 | `MILESTONE_STAGE=5` | `SGPDEMO5.COM` | 320x200, 4bpp, G1 pages A/B, full hidden-page `CLS`, transparent SGP BITBLT |
| M6 | `MILESTONE_STAGE=6` | `SGPDEMO6.COM` | M5 path plus 8x8 bullets, counters, and 1-256 active records |

The educational source ladder is under
[`tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/milestones/`](../tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/milestones/).
The baseline generator is
[`build_milestone_coms.sh`](../tools/pc88va/sgp-pseudo-sprite/build_milestone_coms.sh).
The baseline rebuild produced `SGPDEMO5.COM` (20,746 bytes) and
`SGPDEMO6.COM` (20,734 bytes) with the repository NASM tool. A bounded VAEG
run booted the disposable PC-Engine disk, launched M5, exercised `+` and `-`,
and exited without a synchronization error. This is a smoke result, not a
hardware performance claim.

## VAEG SGP execution model

The implementation is in [`io/sgp.c`](../io/sgp.c) and
[`io/sgp.h`](../io/sgp.h). `sgp_step()` is called from the emulator's timed
execution. It adds elapsed CPU-clock units (scaled by the configured SGP
clock ratio) to `sgp.remainclock` and executes command fetch or drawing steps
while the budget is positive. This is a cooperative emulator model, not a
host thread running concurrently with the CPU.

The model clock is `PCBASECLOCK40` for VA and twice that for VA2. The
`model`, `follow-cpu`, and custom SGP multiplier modes are selected through
the existing configuration/CLI and must be treated as timing-model inputs.
No SGP timing coefficient is changed by M7.

### Command costs in the current model

The following are source-level deductions from `io/sgp.c`:

| Operation | Fixed deduction in the current model |
|---|---:|
| `SET_WORK` | `23 * 2` |
| `SET_SOURCE` | `106 * 2` |
| `SET_DESTINATION` | `106 * 2` |
| `SET_COLOR` | `10 * 2` |
| `BITBLT` / `PATBLT` setup | `338 * 2` |
| `CLS` setup | `26 * 2` |

`END` itself has no explicit clock deduction. BITBLT and PATBLT then share
the same execution engine. For forward 4bpp transfer, the current model
charges `8 * 2` per destination word for opaque transfer, `10 * 2` for
source-transparent transfer, and `14 * 2` per completed row. The inner pixel
packing loop determines the word/mask contents but has no separate per-pixel
clock deduction. Start-dot alignment, bpp, direction, ROP, and transparent
mode can therefore affect the path, but this is not a simple byte or pixel
throughput model.

`CLS` writes one word in `exec_cls()` and deducts `3 * 2` per word. Its
timing is therefore fixed setup plus word-count dependent; it is not an
instantaneous host-memory fill.

### CPU interaction and polling

The SGP busy bit is controlled through `0506h`. Starting a list sets the SGP
function to command fetch; `END` clears busy. Status reads do not have a
special SGP penalty in `io/sgp.c`. They do consume CPU execution time, and
the resulting elapsed CPU clock is what lets `sgp_step()` advance. A tight
poll therefore replaces useful CPU work even though it does not add a
separate modeled bus charge.

## Clear/fill primitives

`CLS (000Ah)` consumes an even 32-bit address and a 32-bit word count and is
a contiguous linear fill. It cannot clear an arbitrary pitch-aware rectangle
without also writing the gaps between rows.

`PATBLT (0008h)` is present in the command table and calls the same block
engine as BITBLT, with source wrapping in X/Y. VAEG's logical operation table
maps ROP 5 to source copy. With a 1x1 4bpp RAM word containing zero, mode
`0005h` (`TP=0`, source-copy ROP) is therefore the verified VAEG mechanism for
an opaque zero rectangle: the source zero is copied, not skipped. Mode `0105h`
would be wrong for clearing because TP=1 suppresses source-zero pixels.
This use is implementation evidence and is kept separate from any claim about
an authoritative hardware timing formula.

## VBLANK and display page

The demo polls TSP status port `0142h`, bit `40h`, waiting for low then high.
It writes FB1 display-start address through `022Eh`--`0230h` only after that
transition. This is the existing VAEG display scheduling path; no VBLANK
interrupt is assumed.

## Measurement consequences

The existing M6 path calls calendar BIOS `INT 8Ch/AH=02` once per frame and
performs `MUL` arithmetic for fixed sprite transfer statistics inside the
command-builder loop. Those operations are part of the measured CPU path, so
M7a will move the FPS time base to low-frequency/VBLANK-based bookkeeping and
hoist fixed transfer quantities. The existing 60/30-style step remains a
secondary VAEG timing-model regression metric, not a continuous hardware FPS
curve.

M7 logical-work counters will use the names `logical` or `modeled`; they will
not be described as physical bus bytes. A dirty clear can reduce logical
destination/source work while producing a smaller or larger VAEG cycle change,
because the current model weights command setup, words, rows, and transparent
mode separately.

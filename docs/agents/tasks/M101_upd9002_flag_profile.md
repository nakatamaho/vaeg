# M101 - µPD9002 Z80-emulation-mode flag profile and real-machine probes

Status: **in progress**

Predecessor: `main` at `6fcb2992593ae8da287fa92fd77f62dec4d67d1b`
(M100 ZEX report).

Branch: `topic/m101-upd9002-flag-profile`

Commit prefix: `M101:`

Evidence document: `docs/modernization/uPD9002-zex-results.md`

## Background

The NEC µPD9002 (PC-88VA) has a Z80 emulation mode used in V1/V2 mode. In
vaeg it is the uPD70008-compatible main-CPU mode (`cpu/upd9002_upd70008.*`).
ZEXDOC and ZEXALL were run on a real PC-88VA2 in V2 mode, using builds of the
exercisers modified to write their console output to a file (`ZEXDOC.TXT`,
`ZEXALL.TXT`). The found CRCs were reproduced exactly (32 bits) by a Z80 core
with seven flag rules:

- R1: F bits 5/3 (Y/X) are always 0.
- R2: AND sets H = 0.
- R3: BIT n,r / (HL) / (IX+d) / (IY+d) sets H = 0.
- R4: RLCA/RRCA/RLA/RRA preserve H and N.
- R5: LDI/LDD/LDIR/LDDR preserve H and N.
- R6: ADD HL/IX/IY,rr preserves H.
- R7: ADC/SBC HL,rr take H from the carry/borrow out of bit 3.

Unresolved (U1): the `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` group (found CRC `6096b6aa` in both
suites) is not reproduced by any model tried.

Open question for R1: whether F can store bits 5/3 at all (e.g. via POP AF)
is not exercised by ZEX.

The modified exerciser source and executables used for the first real-machine
run were not preserved (report O5). M101 therefore rebuilds file-output
exercisers from recorded sources, and the real-machine ZEX runs are repeated
with them.

## Decisions

- **Profile names.** The suzukiplan core gains a per-instance
  `Z80::FlagProfile` with exactly two values:
  - `Upd780`: the default. Documented and undocumented Zilog Z80 behaviour,
    as implemented by NEC's µPD780C second source. This is the existing
    behaviour and is used by the FDC CPU (`UPD780C`).
  - `Upd9002`: the R1–R7 profile of the µPD9002 Z80 emulation mode. It uses
    the storage variant of R1 and keeps µPD780 behaviour for DAA/CPL/SCF/CCF
    until U1 is resolved. It is used by the uPD70008-compatible main-CPU
    adapter.
- **Core patches.** The two reviewed patches are applied to the vendored
  suzukiplan tree through the M36 provenance procedure, never by hand:
  1. `0001-fix-adc-sbc-hl-carry.patch`: ADC/SBC HL,rr folded the carry into
     the 16-bit operand before computing flags. H is wrong whenever
     `rr & 0FFFh = 0FFFh` and C = 1, P/V whenever `rr & 7FFFh = 7FFFh` and
     C = 1, and C as well when rr = FFFFh. The carry is now passed
     separately.
  2. `0002-add-upd9002-flag-profile.patch`, with the reference profile named
     `Upd780` instead of `Zilog`.
- **ZEX sources are imported** under `external/zex/` (GPL-2.0-or-later
  sources with the upstream bundled license). They are never compiled into,
  linked into, or packaged with a vaeg executable or release archive. They
  are used only by the user-run CP/MVA disk installer and by host tests. The
  release-archive audit keeps rejecting every ZEX name and hash; the source
  archive audit accepts exactly the recorded `external/zex/` files. This
  amends the ADR-0011 acquisition policy and is recorded in a new ADR.
- **Assembler.** All CP/M programs are built with the lock-pinned z80asm 1.8
  used by `tools/cpmva`. The ZMAC-dialect ZEX sources are converted by a
  deterministic vaeg translator. Acceptance: the translated stock sources
  assemble byte-identically to the hash-pinned stock `zexdoc.cim` and
  `zexall.cim`.
- **GPL boundary for derived programs.** File-output exercisers and `ZEX13S`
  are derived from ZEX and are GPL-2.0-or-later. Their modifications are kept
  as patches next to the translator and are marked as such. `FLAGPRB` and
  `DAADUMP` are independent vaeg programs under BSD-2-Clause.

## General constraints for the CP/M programs

- Code, comments and commit messages in English.
- Target is CP/M 2.2 BDOS as seen in PC-88VA2 V2 mode. Use only BDOS
  functions 2, 9, 13–16, 19, 21, 22 and 26. File names are 8.3 upper case.
- **No self-modifying code in the new probe programs.** The µPD9002 is
  V30-based and has an instruction prefetch queue. Use separate code paths
  per instruction instead. The ZEX-derived programs keep ZEX's own iut
  mechanism, which is known to work on this machine.
- Set F only through `PUSH rr / POP AF`. Every input F value must have
  bits 5/3 clear, except in P7, which tests storage itself.
- Capture results with `PUSH AF`, and store any other registers, immediately
  after the instruction under test, before any other code runs.
- Control flow in the new programs may branch only on Z, C or S produced by
  INC/DEC/CP/OR/XOR. These are verified to match the Z80 on this machine.
  Never branch on H/N/P, or on flags produced by the instructions under test.
- Disable interrupts around each instruction under test and its capture:
  `DI ... EI` per probe, not for the whole run.
- Output files must be byte-identical in format between the host run and the
  real-machine run.
- Do not change the µPD780 profile behaviour of the core.
- Do not guess hardware behaviour. When something is ambiguous, stop and
  report.

## Stages

Each stage is one or more single-concern commits. Stages A–D are completed
before the first real-machine hand-over; stage E waits for real-machine
outputs.

### Stage A: import ZEX and rebuild it with z80asm

1. Import `zexdoc.src`, `zexall.src` and the bundled `LICENSE.txt` from
   suzukiplan/z80 `test-ex` at the ADR-0011 base commit into `external/zex/`
   byte-for-byte, with a `provenance.txt` recording URLs and SHA-256.
2. Add the ADR amending the ADR-0011 acquisition policy. Update
   `tests/z80_compat/check_zex_archive.py` with separate source-archive and
   release-archive modes, and use the source mode only for the `git archive`
   check in CI. The release mode stays the default and remains strict.
3. Add the translator and a verifier that rebuilds both stock exercisers
   with z80asm 1.8 and compares them with the hash-pinned `.cim` files.

### Stage B: file-output exercisers and the CP/MVA tools disk

1. `ZEXDOCF.COM` and `ZEXALLF.COM`: stock exercisers that also write every
   console byte to `ZEXDOC.TXT` / `ZEXALL.TXT` (BDOS 19, 22, 26, 21, 16;
   128-byte records, final record padded with 1Ah). `msbt` must not move.
   The test table, descriptors, and CRC code are unchanged.
2. A host CP/M runner built on the vendored core: BDOS 2, 9, 13–16, 19, 21,
   22 and 26 mapped to a host directory, plus `--profile upd780|upd9002`
   once stage C is in place.
3. Host acceptance: the file content equals the console output, and the
   stock expected CRCs pass 67/67 under µPD780.
4. `tools/cpmva/install_cpmva.py` puts the stock `ZEXDOC.COM` and
   `ZEXALL.COM`, the file-output variants, and the stage D programs on
   `cpmva-tools.d88`, building them from `external/zex/` and in-tree probe
   sources with the pinned z80asm. The build manifest records their SHA-256.
   Because the tools disk has too little free space for the DAADUMP output,
   the installer also writes `cpmva-test.d88`, which holds only these
   programs (maintainer decision, 2026-09-29).

### Stage C: core profile and emulator integration

1. Record the two core patches under `docs/agents/reports/`, reproduce the
   vendored tree from the approved base plus the M35 patch plus these
   patches, and update `external/suzukiplan-z80/provenance.txt` and
   ADR-0011.
2. Add the profile to `Z80CompatCpu`. The uPD70008 adapter selects
   `Upd9002`; `UPD780C` keeps `Upd780`. Adapter paths that write F outside
   the core (LD A,I / LD A,R materialization, register import, `SetReg`,
   `SetMainReg`) must honour R1.
3. Regression: the stock suites pass 67/67 under `Upd780`, and under
   `Upd9002` every group except #13 matches the real-machine outcome and
   found CRC in the evidence document.
4. Record the ADC/SBC HL defect and the µPD9002 flag correction in
   `docs/modernization/bug-fixes.md`.

### Stage D: real-machine probe programs

#### `FLAGPRB.COM` → `FLAGPRB.TXT`

Run each probe below, and write one line per probe in this format:

```
<id> IN A=xx F=xx BC=xxxx DE=xxxx HL=xxxx OUT A=xx F=xx BC=xxxx DE=xxxx HL=xxxx [MEM=xx]
```

For LDI, `MEM` is the destination byte. After the probe lines, write the
machine-independent expected values as comment lines starting with `#`.
Echo everything to the console as well.

| id | Setup | Instruction(s) under test | µPD780 | µPD9002 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | A=5Ah, F=00h | `XOR A` (control) | A 00h F 44h | A 00h F 44h |
| P1 | A=FFh, F=00h | `AND 0Fh` | A 0Fh F 1Ch | A 0Fh F 04h |
| P2 | A=01h, F=00h | `BIT 0,A` | F 10h | F 00h |
| P3 | A=80h, F=D7h | `RLCA` | A 01h F C5h | A 01h F D7h |
| P4a | A=00h, (HL)=00h, HL=src, DE=dst, BC=0001h, F=D7h | `LDI` | F C1h, BC 0000h | F D3h, BC 0000h |
| P4b | as P4a, BC=0002h | `LDI` | F C5h, BC 0001h | F D7h, BC 0001h |
| P5a | HL=0FFFh, BC=0001h, F=00h | `ADD HL,BC` | HL 1000h F 10h | HL 1000h F 00h |
| P5b | HL=0001h, BC=0001h, F=10h | `ADD HL,BC` | HL 0002h F 00h | HL 0002h F 10h |
| P6a | HL=000Fh, BC=0001h, F=00h | `ADC HL,BC` | HL 0010h F 00h | HL 0010h F 10h |
| P6b | HL=0010h, BC=0001h, F=00h | `SBC HL,BC` | HL 000Fh F 02h | HL 000Fh F 12h |
| P7a | BC=FFFFh | `PUSH BC / POP AF / PUSH AF / POP BC` | C FFh | C D7h |
| P7b | BC=FFFFh | `PUSH BC / POP AF / EX AF,AF' / EX AF,AF' / PUSH AF / POP BC` | C FFh | C D7h |
| P7c | BC=0028h | as P7a | C 28h | C 00h |
| P7d | BC=FFFFh | `PUSH BC / POP AF / INC DE / PUSH AF / POP BC` | C FFh | C D7h |

- The µPD9002 values for P7 are the prediction of the R1 storage variant.
  The alternative, the computation variant, predicts the µPD780 values. P7
  decides which variant is correct.
- The table values were derived by hand. The host runs of both profiles must
  reproduce them exactly. If they do not, stop and report the discrepancy;
  do not edit the table to match.

#### `ZEX13S.COM` → `ZEX13S.TXT`

Derived from the file-output ZEXDOC. Test table, in this order:

1. `aluop a,nn` — unchanged. Build control; the real machine is known to give
   `12967d59`.
2. `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` — unchanged. Build control; the real machine is known
   to give `6096b6aa`.
3. Eight new groups: DAA, CPL, SCF and CCF, each once with flag mask D7h and
   once with FFh.
   - Copy the original `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` descriptor.
   - Set the opcode byte to 27h, 2Fh, 37h or 3Fh.
   - Set the instruction-byte counter mask to 00h.
   - Keep every other base, counter and shifter field unchanged.
   - Messages, for example: `daa (d7)`, `daa (ff)`, `cpl (d7)`, …
   - Expected CRCs are those of the µPD780 profile, computed on the host.

Layout requirements:

- Do not move `msbt`. Keep the file-output routine unchanged.
- Verify on the host that the two control groups give their stock ZEXDOC
  expected CRCs under µPD780: `aluop a,nn` → `48799360`,
  `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` → `9b4ba675`.
- Verify under µPD9002 that `aluop a,nn` gives `12967d59`.

#### `DAADUMP.COM` → `DAA.BIN`, `CPL.BIN`, `SCF.BIN`, `CCF.BIN`, `DAADUMP.TXT`

An exhaustive dump. It fully determines U1 and supersedes the CRC split for
diagnosis.

- For each instruction in {DAA, CPL, SCF, CCF}, use a separate unrolled code
  path per instruction:
  - Loop `fi` from 0 to 63. Map `fi` to `F_in` by spreading its 6 bits over
    F bits 7, 6, 4, 2, 1, 0 (S, Z, H, P/V, N, C), so bits 5/3 stay clear.
  - Loop `a` from 00h to FFh.
  - Set A=`a`, F=`F_in`, execute the instruction, capture AF, and append the
    two bytes `A_out, F_out`.
- Record order is `offset = (fi*256 + a)*2`. Each file is exactly 32768 bytes.
- Stream records through 128-byte sequential writes rather than buffering the
  whole file.
- `DAADUMP.TXT` contains one line per file: name, size, and a CRC-32 (the
  standard reflected polynomial EDB88320h, init FFFFFFFFh, final XOR
  FFFFFFFFh). Print the same lines on the console so they can be checked
  against a photograph.

#### Host side

1. Build all CP/M programs and record their SHA-256 in `MANIFEST.TXT`.
2. Run each program under both profiles. Store the outputs as
   `ref/upd780/*` and `ref/upd9002/*`.
3. Write `compare.py <real_dir>`. It compares the real-machine outputs with
   both references and prints the following.
   - `FLAGPRB`: per probe, the verdict UPD780, UPD9002, BOTH or NEITHER, plus
     the differing bits.
   - `ZEX13S`: per group, the found CRC and whether it equals the µPD780
     expected value, the µPD9002 host value, or neither. For the two control
     groups, whether the real machine reproduced `12967d59` and `6096b6aa`.
   - `ZEXDOC.TXT` / `ZEXALL.TXT`: per group, whether the real result equals
     the µPD9002 host result and the first-run evidence.
   - Dumps, per instruction:
     - the number of mismatching records against µPD780;
     - a breakdown by output field (A, and each F bit S, Z, Y, H, X, P/V, N,
       C);
     - a breakdown by input class (H_in, N_in, C_in) and by A nibble range;
     - the first 20 mismatching records in full.
   - A check that the real `DAADUMP.TXT` CRC-32 values match the real `.BIN`
     files, to detect disk or transfer corruption.
4. Acceptance before handing the programs over for the real-machine run:
   - The host µPD780 run of `FLAGPRB` matches the µPD780 column exactly, and
     the host µPD9002 run matches the µPD9002 column exactly.
   - `ZEX13S` under µPD780 reports OK for all ten groups.
   - All ZEXDOC and ZEXALL regressions that already pass still pass.

### Stage E: real-machine results (only after the maintainer supplies them)

1. Run `compare.py` and report the results verbatim.
2. R1 variant.
   - If P7 matches µPD9002, keep the storage variant.
   - If it matches µPD780, switch R1 to the computation variant: remove the
     masking at POP AF, `setAF`/`setAF2` and reset, and keep `setFlagX`/
     `setFlagY` disabled.
   - Then re-run everything.
3. U1.
   - Derive rules for DAA/CPL/SCF/CCF only from the dumps.
   - Implement them in the µPD9002 profile, each with a rule id and comment.
   - Acceptance:
     - All four host dumps are byte-identical to the real dumps.
     - The found CRC of `<daa,cpl,scf,ccf>` is `6096b6aa` in both stock
       ZEXDOC and stock ZEXALL.
     - Full stock ZEXDOC and ZEXALL under µPD9002 match the real machine in
       all 67 groups.
     - The µPD780 profile still passes 67/67 in both suites.
   - If the dumps do not determine a rule unambiguously, stop and report
     rather than choosing one.
4. Update `docs/modernization/uPD9002-zex-results.md`.
   - Record the evidence status of each rule as directly observed or
     CRC-reproduced.
   - Resolve U1 and O6/P7 there, and close O5 with the recorded exerciser
     sources and hashes.

## Machine checks

- `python3 tools/repo/*.py` checks listed in `CONVENTIONS.md`.
- `cmake --preset linux-debug` build and `ctest`, including the standalone
  `vaeg_z80_compat_*` conformance targets with `VAEG_ZEX_ARTIFACT_DIR`.
- ZEX byte-identity verification and host CP/M runs from stages A–D.
- `check_zex_archive.py` in source mode on `git archive HEAD` and in release
  mode on a locally staged package.

## Gate

G101 is a human gate:

1. The standard gate: build from a clean checkout, boot in V3 mode, run the
   bundled VA demo, boot an OS and perform simple operations.
2. Generate the CP/MVA disks with the installer, boot CP/MVA, and confirm
   that the new programs are listed by `DIR` on `cpmva-tools.d88` and
   `cpmva-test.d88`.
3. Real-machine runs of `ZEXDOCF`, `ZEXALLF`, `FLAGPRB`, `ZEX13S` and
   `DAADUMP` on a PC-88VA2 in V2 mode, followed by stage E.

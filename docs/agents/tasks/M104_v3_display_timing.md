# M104 - V3 display timing: non-native line counts and line doubling

Status: **in progress**

Series: V3 series, first milestone (maintainer decision 2026-10-06: the
display-timing work takes M104; SGP moves to a later milestone). Branch
`topic/m104-undocumented-tsp-display-semigraphics` (renamed from
`topic/m104-v3-display-timing` on 2026-10-06) off `main` at
`9ff34397f24af238f239540d96c526b28871debb`. Commit prefix `M104:`.

## Goal

Measure on real hardware which TSP `SYNC` timings beyond the documented
200/204/400/408-line profiles a PC-88VA displays, record the results with
`[MEAS]`, and make vaeg show them: 480-line frames (VIEW480), 15 kHz frames
of up to 256 lines (320x240), and 24.8 kHz line doubling (port `0100h`
RSM = 01) beyond 200 lines.

## Background

- `[VA-TM]` 4.9.4: 15 kHz cannot show 400/408 lines; at 24.8 kHz a 200/204-
  line graphics screen has blank odd rasters (RSM = 00) or each line on an
  even/odd raster pair (RSM = 01). Graphics resolutions are 640/320 dots and
  200/204/400/408 lines.
- uPD72022 data book (via [`upd72022-tsp.md`](../../modernization/upd72022-tsp.md)
  10.1): at most 512 active lines; `VS >= 4`, `BBR + BBL >= 2`, top
  blanking plus border at least 10h without sprites and 20h with sprites.
- VIEW480 (mami, 1992; Softlib 2-404) switches a 640 x 401-480 picture to a
  480-line 24.8 kHz frame with bottom blanking and sync of 1 line each, below
  those minimums.
- vaeg (main at the branch point): headless screenshots of these timings
  stay 640 x 422 (400 display lines); a 480-line frame and a 15 kHz
  240-line frame are not shown in full. Where the limit lies is part of
  scope 3.

## Scope

1. **Test program** (done in this milestone): `tools/pc88va/vtiming/
   v480pat.asm` (2-clause BSD, independent of VIEW480) and a disk builder.
2. **Measurements**: results in this file and in
   [`pc88va-video-modes.md`](../../modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md),
   tagged `[MEAS]`.
3. **vaeg**: output height from the TSP frame (`VAD`, RM, monitor switch);
   15 kHz frames up to 256 lines; 24.8 kHz frames up to 480 rasters;
   line doubling with RSM = 01 beyond 200 lines; graphics fetch extent below
   `VAD` as measured; `HAD` narrowing only if the measurement shows it.
4. **Tests**: romless tests feeding the measured `SYNC`/`GRMODE` settings.

## Gate G104 (human)

Standard V3 gate unchanged, plus: in vaeg, `VIEW480`, `V480PAT 240 T W`,
`V480PAT 240 U W` and `V480PAT 232 D` show what the real machine showed.

## Implementation progress

- Test program and builder committed:
  [`tools/pc88va/vtiming/README.md`](../../../tools/pc88va/vtiming/README.md).
- `[MEAS]` First hardware round (2026-10-05/06): recorded in
  [`pc88va-video-modes.md` section 12](../../modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md#12-measured-non-native-timings).
  Machine: PC-88VA2. Open: where the 240-line pictures lose their last
  line; the horizontal result of `N`.
- Line ruler added to V480PAT for the second round.
- `[MEAS]` Second round (2026-10-06):
  [`pc88va-video-modes.md` 12.1](../../modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md#121-second-round-line-ruler),
  with photographs. At 15.98 kHz graphics show `TBL + VAD - 37` lines; at
  24.8 kHz with RSM = 01 graphics stop advancing after line 200; graphics
  are not clipped by the TSP `HAD`; `240 T` (640 dots) follows the same
  rule. Open: whether 15 kHz graphics are shifted by `37 - TBL` against
  text.
- Added TSPMODE (probe of undocumented screen-table `MODE` values) and
  G160 (160 x 100 with a colour per dot in graphics). `[MEAS]` G160 runs on
  the PC-88VA2 as in vaeg (checks and moving gradient visible); hardware
  redraw rates pending.
- `[MEAS]` TSPMODE on the PC-88VA2: `MODE` 8-14 show non-character
  patterns (candidates for the semigraphics/graphics static-picture
  modes), 6-7 are attribute variants, 15-20 break the text; recorded in
  [`upd72022-tsp.md`](../../modernization/upd72022-tsp.md) section 20.4.
  Next: identify the format of 8-14 with known TVRAM data.
- `[MEAS]` G256 on the PC-88VA2: a 256 x 192 window in native 320 x 200
  graphics is shown at 15.98 and 24.8 kHz and at 16, 8 and 4 bits, matching
  vaeg; recorded in
  [`pc88va-video-modes.md`](../../modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md)
  section 12.3.
- `[MEAS]` Third round (2026-10-07, sweeps): 24.8 kHz 400-line graphics
  are shown past line 400 up to 480 (`480 S K`, 49.7 Hz); 15.98 kHz with top
  blanking 37 shows all of 200-240 lines (320 x 240 at 56.5 Hz works);
  `244/248 R W` show only lines 0-239; monitor limits 503/507 lines at
  24.8 kHz and 291/294 at 15.98 kHz; G160 runs 2.1-2.2 times faster in
  vaeg than on the PC-88VA2 at every depth; TSPMODE 21-31 recorded.
  [`pc88va-video-modes.md`](../../modernization/pc88va-video-modes.md)
  section 12.4,
  [`upd72022-tsp.md`](../../modernization/upd72022-tsp.md) section 20.4.
- vaeg implements the rules (480-row canvas, 24.8 kHz doubling stop,
  15.98 kHz start delay and top hiding, RSM = 00 blank past line 200;
  `pc88va-video-modes.md` sections 12.5 and 12.6):

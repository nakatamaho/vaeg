# M19 - Consolidate the portable runtime and VA sound hardware

Status: implementation complete; G19 pending

Branch: `main` (the four implementation commits were integrated directly)

Gate: G19 human

Depends on: G18 passed.

## Goal

Make the active SDL2 application and its release artifacts self-contained,
give the portable frontend a single configuration identity, align backup
memory with that configuration's portable lookup policy, and represent the
VA model's OPN/OPNA hardware explicitly.

M19 covers four already-integrated concerns:

1. embed the host GUI font and startup splash, and make release SDL2 linkage
   self-contained where supported;
2. replace the active frontend's `np2.ini`, `np2.cfg`, and `vaeg.ini` names
   with the single `vaeg.cfg` name, without compatibility fallback;
3. give `vabkupmem.dat` the same executable-local-first portable policy;
4. distinguish the VA built-in YM2203/OPN from the YM2608/OPNA hardware in
   VA Sound Board II and VA2/VA3.

## Constraints

- Do not modify `win9x/`, `i286x/`, `cpuxva/memoryva.x86`, or `hlp/`.
- Do not restore compatibility lookup for `np2.ini`, `np2.cfg`, or
  `vaeg.ini` in the active frontend.
- Do not put writable backup memory in the ROM lookup directory.
- Keep NP2/ymfm synthesis-backend selection independent from OPN/OPNA
  hardware selection.
- Do not define `OPNGENX86`.
- Do not add ROM, disk, WAV, or other user payloads to the repository.

## Delivered runtime packaging

`assets/vaeg.bmp` and `assets/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf` are canonical source
assets. CMake converts them into generated C byte arrays and links them into
the active executable. Normal startup displays the embedded VAEG splash for
approximately 1500 ms; smoke and selftest runs do not add that delay. Dear
ImGui loads the embedded Noto Sans JP data and no longer requires an external
font file.

`VAEG_STATIC_SDL2` controls static SDL2 linkage. Release presets which use
the pinned FetchContent SDL2 path enable it, so a Windows release does not
require `SDL2.dll` beside `vaeg.exe`. System-SDL development configurations
remain supported and do not silently claim static linkage when only a shared
package is available. License and attribution files remain in the release
documentation even when assets or SDL2 are linked into the executable.

## Configuration identity and lookup

The active SDL2 frontend uses only `vaeg.cfg`. At startup it selects the
first existing file in this order:

1. `vaeg.cfg` beside the executable;
2. `vaeg.cfg` in the platform user-state directory.

If neither exists, the frontend creates and subsequently updates the
user-state copy. Reads and writes continue using the selected path for the
process lifetime. The removed names are not migration aliases.

The user-state directory remains platform-specific:

- Linux: XDG state/config location selected by the existing SDL2 path shim;
- Windows: `%APPDATA%\vaeg`;
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/vaeg`.

## Backup-memory lookup

`vabkupmem.dat` follows the same portable-selection principle:

1. if an executable-local `vabkupmem.dat` already exists, load and save that
   file;
2. otherwise load and save the user-state `vabkupmem.dat`.

The executable-local file must already exist before startup; this prevents a
normal installed application from unexpectedly creating writable state in a
read-only executable directory. Backup memory no longer falls back to the ROM
path. The selected path is passed into the shared VA backup-memory module;
the frozen Win32 behavior is unchanged.

## VA OPN and OPNA hardware

M19 separates sound hardware identity from the NP2/ymfm FM synthesis choice.
The configuration values are:

| `SNDboard` | Emulated hardware | Availability |
|---:|---|---|
| `100` | VA built-in YM2203/OPN, 3 FM channels + PSG | VA only |
| `200` | YM2608/OPNA, 6 FM channels + PSG + rhythm + ADPCM | VA Sound Board II and VA2/VA3 |

Fresh VA configuration selects OPN. Fresh VA2/VA3 configuration selects
OPNA. VA may explicitly select OPNA to represent Sound Board II; VA2/VA3
cannot select the VA-only built-in OPN entry in the GUI.

At guest reset, `SNDboard` selects the board reset and bind path. OPN binds
the primary `44h/45h` ports. OPNA additionally binds `46h/47h`, the second FM
bank, rhythm, and ADPCM. With OPN selected, accesses to the unbound extension
ports are ignored on write and return `ffh` on read. Guest software can
therefore probe the installed capability through normal emulated hardware
I/O; the emulator does not infer the chip from ROM contents or register
writes.

The `opn_backend=np2|ymfm` setting from M17 chooses only the FM operator
implementation. It does not add or remove OPNA ports or peripherals.

## Machine verification

Run from a clean checkout:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-debug
ctest --preset linux-debug

SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy ./build/linux-debug/sdl2/vaeg --selftest
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  ./build/linux-debug/sdl2/vaeg --smoke

cmake --preset linux-release
cmake --build --preset linux-release
cmake --preset mingw-cross
cmake --build --preset mingw-cross

git diff --check
python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py

git diff --stat HEAD -- win9x i286x cpuxva/memoryva.x86 hlp
rg -n "np2\\.(ini|cfg)|vaeg\\.ini|OPNGENX86" \
  sdl2 CMakeLists.txt CMakePresets.json
```

The final search may find historical prose only if explicitly labeled as
removed behavior. It must not find active compatibility lookup or a forbidden
`OPNGENX86` definition.

## Gate G19

G19 is a human portable-runtime and VA-sound gate:

### Distribution and startup

- launch the Windows-MinGW executable from Explorer, outside an MSYS2 shell;
- confirm it starts without external SDL2 or font assets;
- confirm normal startup displays the embedded splash for about 1500 ms;
- confirm `--smoke` and `--selftest` remain unattended and successful;
- repeat a normal launch on Linux and macOS where available.

### Configuration and backup memory

- with no executable-local file, confirm the application creates and updates
  only the platform user-state `vaeg.cfg`;
- place a valid `vaeg.cfg` beside the executable and confirm it overrides the
  user-state file and receives subsequent changes;
- confirm `np2.ini`, `np2.cfg`, and `vaeg.ini` are neither read nor created;
- with no executable-local `vabkupmem.dat`, change persistent VA settings and
  confirm the user-state backup file is updated and restored after restart;
- place an existing `vabkupmem.dat` beside the executable and confirm it is
  loaded, updated in place, and takes precedence over the user-state copy;
- confirm no `vabkupmem.dat` is written into the ROM path.

### VA sound hardware

- boot VA with built-in OPN, run the VA demo and an OS, and confirm FM and PSG;
- select OPNA on VA, accept the reset, and confirm Sound Board II material can
  use the added FM channels, rhythm, and ADPCM;
- boot VA2/VA3 and confirm OPNA is selected and the VA-only OPN GUI entry is
  disabled;
- verify sound-hardware selection persists across restart;
- repeat the checks with both NP2 and ymfm synthesis backends and confirm that
  changing backend does not change which hardware ports are exposed;
- verify configured FDD and SASI media survive sound-hardware resets.

### Standard VA regression

- boot V3 mode;
- run the bundled VA demo;
- boot an OS and perform simple disk and keyboard operations;
- exit cleanly.

G19 passes only after the maintainer reports these checks passed.

## Commit record

```text
08e783c M19: embed frontend assets and static-link release SDL2
bf60ccb M19: rename portable configuration to vaeg.cfg
4d4f8a0 M19: align backup memory with portable config lookup
e50fbbd M19: add model-aware VA OPN and OPNA selection
```

## Residual risks

- OPN/OPNA presence is represented by port binding and chip behavior, not a
  separate board-identification register. Software using an undocumented
  detection sequence may require targeted comparison with real hardware.
- Static SDL2 depends on the selected CMake package exposing
  `SDL2::SDL2-static`; system development packages may remain shared.
- An executable-local backup file is intentionally writable portable state;
  using it under a protected installation directory can make saves fail.

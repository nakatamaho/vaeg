# M27: Frame display

## Goal

Restore the original VAEG `Frame Disp` function in the active SDL2 frontend.
The Screen menu exposes a persistent `Frame display` toggle. When enabled,
the native window title reports the measured draw rate as `N.NFPS`.

## Audited behavior

The frozen Win9x implementation is read-only evidence:

- `win9x/np2.cpp` toggles bit 1 of `np2oscfg.DISPCLK` for `IDM_DISPFRAME`.
- `win9x/ini.cpp` persists the low two bits as `DspClock`.
- `win9x/sysmng.cpp` samples the global `drawcount` over at least 2000 ms,
  computes tenths of a frame per second, and appends the result to the native
  window title.
- `drawcount` counts guest framebuffer draws. It is not the SDL present rate,
  configured frame-skip value, CPU speed, or guest VBlank frequency.

The active core retains the same `drawcount` increment points in `pccore.c`.
M27 therefore reuses that counter and does not alter core timing or drawing.

## Implementation

- `sdl2/framedisp.c` contains the C99, wrap-safe two-second measurement state,
  driven by SDL's monotonic millisecond counter.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c` owns the title suffix and removes it immediately when the
  option is disabled.
- `sdl2/np2.c` samples after each executed guest frame, including frames whose
  host presentation is skipped.
- `DspClock` is restored in `vaeg.cfg`; bit 1 controls Frame display and the
  low two bits are retained for original configuration compatibility.
- Screen -> Frame display toggles the option immediately and marks frontend
  configuration dirty.

The original CPU clock title display represented by bit 0 is not restored in
this milestone. Its configuration bit is preserved but has no active UI or
title effect.

## Non-goals

- Do not modify frame skip, No Wait, F11 fast-forward, guest VBlank timing, or
  CPU/SGP execution speed.
- Do not count Dear ImGui-only presents as guest frames.
- Do not edit the frozen reference tier.
- Do not add an on-screen overlay; the original feature used the window title.

## Automated verification

ROM-less tests cover the two-second renewal threshold, 60.0 and 30.0 FPS
calculations, zero draws, null input, and 32-bit tick/draw counter wrapping.

Run:

```sh
cmake --preset linux-debug
cmake --build --preset linux-debug
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  ./build/linux-debug/sdl2/vaeg --selftest
SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy \
  ./build/linux-debug/sdl2/vaeg --smoke
cmake --preset linux-release
cmake --build --preset linux-release
cmake --preset mingw-cross
cmake --build --preset mingw-cross
python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py
git diff --check
git diff -- win9x i286x cpuxva/memoryva.x86 hlp
```

## G27 human gate

- Enable Screen -> Frame display and confirm the title changes first to
  `0FPS`, then to a stable `N.NFPS` after about two seconds.
- Disable it and confirm the FPS suffix disappears immediately.
- Restart and confirm the setting persists through `DspClock` in `vaeg.cfg`.
- Check Auto, Full frame, 1/2, 1/3, and 1/4 frame skip. The displayed value
  must follow actual guest framebuffer draws without changing guest timing.
- Check No Wait and hold-F11 fast-forward; release F11 and confirm normal
  pacing returns.
- Check Windowed and Exclusive fullscreen behavior. The OS may hide the
  native title in fullscreen; the setting and measurement must remain safe.
- Complete the standard VA gate: V3 boot, VA demo, and OS boot/simple use.

G27 remains open until the user explicitly reports it passed.

## Verification record

The following checks passed on the Linux development host:

- Linux debug configure/build, direct ROM-less selftest, and dummy-driver
  smoke;
- Linux release configure/build, direct ROM-less selftest, and dummy-driver
  smoke;
- Windows-MinGW cross configure/build using the pinned static dependency
  path;
- encoding, EOL, lowercase-path, and `git diff --check` invariants;
- an empty path-scoped diff for `win9x/`, `i286x/`,
  `cpuxva/memoryva.x86`, and `hlp/`.

The configured Linux debug tree does not enable CMake test registration, so
`ctest --test-dir build/linux-debug` reported `No tests were found`. The same
binary's explicit `--selftest` completed successfully, including the new
Frame display cases.

Linux release `vaeg` and Windows-MinGW `vaeg.exe` were copied to the shared
manual-test directory and verified byte-for-byte by SHA-256. Native macOS
build and visible window-title behavior remain outside automated verification.

# M41: Cut over to the replacement Z80 and remove the legacy implementation

Status: draft; blocked until the maintainer explicitly passes G40

Branch: `topic/m41-z80-cutover`

## Required cutover

Make the suzukiplan-backed wrapper the only production core. Remove the legacy
selection, sources, definitions, and CI jobs; keep permanent wrapper,
interrupt, state-fixture, ZEX, disassembler, deterministic self-consistency,
smoke, and archive-audit tests. There is no one-release fallback.

Delete exactly, and only with the standing approval, these seven files:

```text
cpucva/types.h
cpucva/z80.h
cpucva/z80if.h
cpucva/z80c.h
cpucva/z80c.cpp
cpucva/z80diag.h
cpucva/z80diag.cpp
```

Use deletion commits consistent with the repository's one-concern rules. Do
not delete anything else without explicit approval. Remove active includes,
CMake entries, scripts, tests, and package references; frozen reference files
remain untouched and may retain documented historical names.

Update README/build/release documentation, roadmap/task/ADR status, notices,
and packaging records with exact MIT vendored SHA and BSD-2-Clause vaeg
components. Update the bug ledger only for demonstrated corrected defects.
History is not rewritten.

## Release and permanent QA

Build the real distribution archive and machine-readable manifest. Fail if it
contains any approved deleted path, renamed/stale copy, ZEX artifact,
unrecorded third-party source, patch work file, or private ROM/disk data. Run
case-insensitive cisc/M88 and exact legacy-path searches; historical migration
documentation hits may remain, but active source/build/package hits may not.
Verify all seven paths are absent from HEAD and archive.

Run complete three-platform CI, invariants, CTest, wrapper/interrupt/state,
ZEX, exhaustive disassembly, bounded deterministic tests, smoke, and release
audit. Preserve final differential/cycle reports without compiling deleted
code.

## Human gate G41

From a clean checkout, the maintainer verifies VA/V3 boot, bundled demo, OS
file operations, FDD read/write, timing-sensitive loader, VA and Sorcerian
idle, WAIT wake, old-save load, new save/load during FDD activity, reset/
reboot, and archive contents. G41 passes only when tests and human regression
pass, all seven files/fallbacks are absent, the archive is clean, and exact
SHAs are reported. Tag only after explicit approval. Stop.

# M98x - Runtime ZUNDAMON count controls and load ladder

Status: **G98x automated evidence complete; human gate pending**

M98x starts from the accepted M98w head `b65d6c50af1f9bd7f574a17683c637e65212be78`.
It keeps the public ZUNDAMON renderer, M98u phase/order generator, M98w
page-local dirty unions, cadence ladder, HUD FPS field, and cleanup behavior.
The normal release guest is one binary with a default count of four. It accepts
one exact `/N1` through `/N16` option (case-insensitive like `/V`), plus the
existing `/V1` through `/V8` option, in either order. UP and DOWN queue bounded
requested-count changes; count state is latched for a complete hidden
transaction and the G0 count field changes only with the matching DSA1
publication. Counts saturate at one and sixteen and never wrap. The global
phase remains continuous modulo 64.

The runtime count path is enabled by `M98X_RUNTIME_MODE=1` in the local build
script. `M98V_ACTIVE_COUNT` remains only for legacy M98v/M98w fixed-count QA
builds. No `/N` or UP/DOWN path is compiled into those compatibility builds.
The release path has statically bounded 16-record, 16-index, and page-footprint
storage and one shared 128-KiB atlas; it adds no private image or payload copy.

The independent host model validates all 1,024 count/phase states, the 32,768
ordered page/count transition cases, count-one equality with M98t, deterministic
HUD tiles, parser negatives, and runtime build reproducibility. The report at
`docs/agents/reports/m98x_zundamon_runtime_count_ladder.md` records the exact
commands, identities, evidence limits, and the remaining VA2 human gate.

M98y remains the later private IDA milestone. M98x does not integrate IDA,
change atlas pixels, alter orbit geometry, add `/N`-specific code copies, or
add gameplay. `REAL_HW_PENDING` remains in force.

# M98aa IDA 64-instance animation

M98aa extends the accepted private IDA profile to a bounded runtime count of
1 through 64 using the existing renderer, one 30-scale atlas bank, complete
dirty-union transactions, and publication-safe page state. The public
ZUNDAMON profile remains byte-identical and limited to 1 through 16.

The private candidate defaults to four instances. `/N1` through `/N64` are
accepted before graphics mode, UP/DOWN saturate at 64/1, and the M98u phase
offset and far-to-near ordering rules are unchanged. Its private demonstration
speed is 1.00X through 4.00X in 0.25X steps; a bounded VBLANK-driven triangle
advances speed and distance once per nominal second while A/Z and Q/E remain
available. Private atlas, manifest, binary, D88, and detailed evidence remain
outside Git.

The implementation stops at the M98aa human visual gate. It does not add 128
instances, private poses, gameplay, or a second atlas bank.

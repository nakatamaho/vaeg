# M98w - Multi-ZUNDAMON dirty-row interval unions

Status: **automated evidence passed; G98w human gate pending**

Branch: `topic/m98w-multi-dirty-union`

Accepted M98v pushed head: `33d15aa090f392d3393083e0ebab99965fc06d22`

Commit prefix: `M98w:`

## Goal

Replace the M98v steady-state complete hidden-page clear with a page-local
union of the committed old multi-instance footprint. Each old logical
rectangle is validated, rounded outward to complete 16-bit words, sorted by
row and x, and merged on overlap or adjacency. Canonical row-major CLS ranges
are emitted in bounded SGP batches. The clear barrier completes before the
unchanged M98v far-to-near transparent BITBLTs, READY state, and VBLANK
publication.

Both physical pages retain independent committed footprints. The first hidden
use skips dirty clearing because both pages are initialized once with a full
clear. Pending rectangles commit only after publication. The accepted M98v
full-clear path remains available as a QA golden mode; the release default is
dirty mode.

## Fixed scope

Build-time counts remain exactly 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, with interactive count 4.
There is no `/N` option and UP/DOWN remain inactive. M98u phase assignment,
descriptor geometry, one-bank atlas, transparent source-zero behavior, HUD,
cadence, page ownership, and cleanup are unchanged. M98w does not add private
IDA data, runtime count controls, interval masks, or a general sprite engine.

## Verification and gate

The independent host union oracle covers word parity, overlap, containment,
adjacency, transitive chains, disjoint gaps, capacity, row/address bounds,
and one-rectangle M98q equivalence. VA2/VAEG bounded captures compare dirty
and full physical G1 and composited bytes, command order, page parity, source
records, and guards. Logical clear work and timing are reported separately;
reduced bytes are not a performance claim.

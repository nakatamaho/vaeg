# M98r - Add selectable VBLANK cadence

Status: **assigned; implementation in progress**

Branch: `topic/m98r-vblank-cadence`

Starting commit: `ade337c2d1f2ec0106a04361e1dd22a9995cb9b7`

Accepted M98q implementation: `6a3f229c74d1ffed9888b279e80334ac76d2e461`

Accepted M98q report and gate head: `ade337c2d1f2ec0106a04361e1dd22a9995cb9b7`

Commit prefix: `M98r:`

Gate type: **automated VA2/VAEG evidence plus maintainer human gate**

## Goal

Add only animation scheduling to the accepted M98q renderer. Accept one
optional `/V1` through `/V8` selector, default to `/V1`, and apply cadence on
fresh VBLANK low-to-high edges. LEFT requests the next faster divisor, RIGHT
the next slower divisor, SPACE requests pause/resume, and ESC exits through
the accepted restoration path.

Divisors 1 through 8 carry nominal labels 60, 30, 20, 15, 12, 10, 8.6, and
7.5 fps. The labels are not measured promises: report the measured display
VBLANK rate, requested rate, publication rate, and missed eligible slots
separately.

## Preserved renderer contract

Keep the public one-bank, 30-scale atlas; exact `30..1..29` sequence; fixed
anchor; independent page-local dirty rectangles; two initialization full
clears and no steady-state full clear; one transparent BMS-to-G1 BITBLT per
rendered update; hidden-page-only work; bounded SGP completion; fresh VBLANK
publication; and transactional page/rectangle/scale commit.

Observe VBLANK through one authoritative edge observer, including while SGP
is busy. Publish a READY page only on a divisor-qualified edge. A missed slot
retains the complete visible page and does not advance the scale. Apply
divisor and pause/resume requests at a VBLANK boundary, reset the partial
divider there, and do not count that boundary toward the new interval.

## Automated evidence

Reproduce M98q full/dirty equality before editing. Add an independent host
scheduler model, fail-closed parser and state-machine tests, bounded generated
event traces, and VA2 cases for all eight static divisors. Cover opposite
initial pages at V1/V4/V8, the V1-to-V8-to-V1 ladder, pause/resume in reachable
render states, missed slots, and all required negative paths. Compare every
publication with the accepted M98q framebuffer golden.

Generated COM, BIN, D88, traces, captures, reports, and backup memory stay
outside Git. No private or ROM-derived material may enter tracked files.

## Human gate

Provide one pristine generated D88. In VA2, the maintainer checks the default
fastest setting, one-step RIGHT/LEFT traversal and endpoint clamping, clean
cadence changes, SPACE pause/resume without a shortened first interval or
scale jump, unchanged transparency/anchor/page quality, and ESC restoration.
Automation cannot close G98r.

## Non-goals

M98r does not add ellipse motion, x/y movement, depth coupling, a private
image, multiple instances, UP/DOWN controls, sound, gameplay, an SGP timing
change, or physical-hardware performance evidence. M98s and M98t remain
separate later milestones.

# M38: Add normalized legacy/new Z80 differential evidence

Status: implemented; G38 passed after eventual convergence was proven under
the maintainer-approved clock policy; stopped before M39

Branch: `topic/m38-z80-differential`

## Goal and harness

Compare externally observable legacy and replacement behavior without changing
production selection. Prefer separate legacy and new runner executables plus a
trace comparator, avoiding class/symbol collisions and production-source
renaming. Emit a versioned deterministic lower-case trace: checkpoint/reason,
authoritative and mirrored registers, IFF/IM/HALT, IRQ/NMI, ordered memory and
masked-I/O transactions, acknowledge events, clocks, end balance, selected
memory hashes, and explicit `Exec()` boundaries.

Normalize at slice return, accepted-interrupt completion, HALT entry/exit,
save/load, completed I/O, and test markers. Do not fail merely because legacy
EI fuses the following instruction; compare at the next common external
checkpoint.

## Corpus and classification

Directed programs cover base, CB/ED/DD/FD/DDCB/FDCB, branches, stack, block
memory/I/O, EI/DI/RETN/RETI, HALT, IM0/1/2, NMI, R, and ZEX-relevant flags.
Event scripts cover DI assertion, EI timing, acknowledge mutation,
deassertion, HALT wake, persistent IRQ, NMI, and frame-boundary state events.
Add bounded deterministic random programs with committed public seeds and a
documented longer local/nightly run.

Classify each divergence as wrapper defect, upstream defect, old-core defect,
deliberate architectural correction, externally inert scheduling difference,
or unresolved. An allowlist requires a minimal input, first event, affected
state, evidence, safety rationale, and issue link where applicable. ZEX alone
does not classify a divergence.

Create `docs/modernization/z80-cycle-deltas.md`, recording scenario deltas and
whether they change event order, FDD behavior, interrupts, WAIT, HALT, or a
guest-visible result. G38 blocks on lost, duplicated, reordered, or
permanently divergent external effects. A slice-boundary shift caused by a
verified architectural timing correction may pass only when identical
additional clock slices prove eventual convergence. Every accepted shift
remains a mandatory M39 private integration risk.

## Gate G38

Run all repository QA, directed and bounded random corpora, reproducibility,
and the recorded long command. Require green or evidence-backed divergences,
an empty/evidence-backed allowlist, cycle report, and unchanged production
core. Push exact traces/report hashes, commands, files, and SHAs, then stop for
review.

## M38 result

The separate `vaeg_z80_legacy_trace`, `vaeg_z80_new_trace`, and
`vaeg_z80_trace_compare` executables implement the canonical
`vaeg-z80-trace-v1` schema without linking both `Z80C` classes into one
process. The normal directed, state, and four-seed generated corpora pass with
only the exact evidence-backed classifications recorded in the
[M38 report](../reports/m38_z80_differential.md). The long local run covers
16,384 generated cases with no allowlist match.

The probes found wrapper-correctable third-party behavior for prefix and HALT
R increments, RETN/RETI IFF restoration, `LD A,I`/`LD A,R` flags, and the
legacy NMI mirror. These corrections are confined to the standalone wrapper,
have focused regressions, and do not edit the vendored tree or production
selection.

The minimal `cycle-fdd-io-scheduling` suite runs `JR +2`
from `0x0000`, then `OUT (0xf4),A` at `0x0004`, with identical clock slices
`1,7`. The legacy core charges 7 clocks for the taken JR and performs the FDD
control-port write in the second `Exec()` call. The new core charges the
architectural 12 clocks and remains at `0x0004`, so it emits no write in that
call. This slice-exact difference stays documented and is intentionally not
relabelled as externally inert or removed.

The `cycle-fdd-io-eventual-convergence` test gives both runners the same
additional `4,1` slices. After 13 clocks the new core has emitted exactly one
`OUT (0xf4),0x5a`; the ordered event sequence, architectural registers,
memory, device-visible hashes, R, and final PC match legacy. There is no lost,
duplicated, or reordered I/O. The remaining differences are the classified
cycle count, clock balance, and earlier slice assignment. G38 therefore
passed under the revised policy. This scheduling difference is a mandatory
M39 private risk; M39 must stop integration on real VA/FDD transfer failure,
timeout, data corruption, IRQ/DRQ sequencing change, or broken save/load.
No legacy per-opcode timing emulation was added, and work is stopped before
M39.

# M98t - Couple orbit depth to 30 scales and add the G0 HUD

Status: **G98t human gate pending; automated VA2/VAEG evidence passed**

Branch: `topic/m98t-depth-scale-hud`

Starting and accepted M98s commit:
`cf542bff4265272f2fd563b10d159b8e65c74966`

Commit prefix: `M98t:`

Gate type: **automated VA2/VAEG evidence plus maintainer human gate**

## Goal

Keep the accepted clockwise 64-phase ellipse and derive a signed depth rank
and stored scale ID 1 through 30 from each phase.  Use the selected
descriptor's own dimensions, pitch, anchor, payload, and BMS source.  Commit
phase, depth, scale, and the page-local logical rectangle only after a READY
hidden page is published on an eligible VBLANK edge.

Add one fixed G0 information panel at `[4,4,70,20)` using a task-authored
public 5x7 font.  It displays the active nominal cadence as `FPS: <field>` and
the immutable text `ZUNDAMON: 1`.  G1 remains a homogeneous one-object layer.

## Preserved renderer and scheduler contract

Preserve the one-bank public atlas, page-A/page-B independent old rectangles,
word-rounded dirty-row CLS, two initialization full clears, zero release
steady-state full clears, one transparent BMS-to-hidden-G1 BITBLT per update,
READY-only publication, and ordinary-mapping/video restoration.

Preserve `/V1` through `/V8`, LEFT/RIGHT, SPACE, ESC, debounce, boundary
reset, pause, and missed-slot rules from M98r/M98s.  Applied divisor changes
replace exactly the 18x8 FPS field on a VBLANK boundary.  UP/DOWN remain
inactive.  No miss, pause, queued change, or failed transaction advances the
phase or scale.

## Automated evidence

Reproduce M98s before editing.  Generate and independently validate the
phase/depth/scale and HUD includes twice, build twice, and compare identities.
Compare `A/full`, `A/dirty`, `B/full`, and `B/dirty` byte-for-byte for two
revolutions.  Run all eight static divisors, opposite-page long V1/V4/V8
cases, the dynamic HUD ladder, pause/resume, consecutive missed slots, and
fail-closed negative tests.  Every publication must match an independent
indexed G0/G1/composite oracle.

Generated COM, BIN, D88, traces, captures, reports, and backup memory remain
outside Git.  No private or ROM-derived material may enter tracked files.

## Human gate

Provide one pristine generated D88.  In VA2, the maintainer checks one
camera-facing marker moving clockwise, largest at the bottom and smallest at
the top, stable descriptor anchors, all cadence fields without stale decimal
pixels, fixed `ZUNDAMON: 1`, inactive UP/DOWN, pause/resume, two revolutions,
and normal ESC restoration.  Automation cannot close G98t.

## Non-goals

M98t does not add private imagery, multiple instances, UP/DOWN count controls,
depth sorting, image rotation, runtime scaling, a measured-FPS HUD, gameplay,
audio, emulator timing changes, or physical-hardware performance evidence.

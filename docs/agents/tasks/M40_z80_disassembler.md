# M40: Replace Z80 disassembly and detach active legacy-header consumers

Status: draft; blocked until the maintainer explicitly passes G39

Branch: `topic/m40-z80-disassembler`

## Goal and implementation

Independently author the ADR-0011 BSD-2-Clause vaeg disassembler from
documented Z80 encodings. Do not copy M88/cisc or GPL tables. Keep both CPU
selections for final comparison, with the previously approved default.

Cover base, CB, ED, DD, FD, DDCB, and FDCB pages; use bounded output; return
next PC or explicit length; wrap reads at `0xffff`; handle reserved/truncated
input deterministically; and include only reviewed canonical undocumented
forms required by the consumer. Preserve the active bridge's `Init(memory)` /
`Disassemble(pc,destination)` behavior or migrate all consumers atomically.
Do not retain unused diagnostic APIs or expose STL/third-party types.

## Tests and detachment

Generate a legal exhaustive opcode-page corpus covering length, next PC,
bounds, state non-mutation, wrap, and stable formatting. Create a manually
reviewed golden output from documented encodings, not from the old
disassembler. A permissively licensed independent length cross-check may flag
review items but is not a source to copy. Perform a legal ROM-less or private
debugger UI spot check without committing proprietary bytes.

Migrate active subsystem/debugger consumers so none includes `z80diag.h`,
`z80.h`, `z80if.h`, or `types.h`. The old CPU target may still use the seven
files internally until M41. Prove this with source search, compiler dependency
output, and link/source-list evidence.

## Gate G40

Run invariants, all builds/CTest/smoke, exhaustive/golden tests on every
platform, debugger spot check, and new-core system smoke. Both CPU selections
must build, and the include graph must confine legacy files to the legacy CPU
target. Push exact evidence and SHAs, then stop; do not cut over or delete.

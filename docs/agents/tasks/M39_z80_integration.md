# M39: Integrate an opt-in replacement Z80 subsystem

Status: implemented for public/ROM-less validation; G38 passed; awaiting the
maintainer-private G39 system tests

Branch: `topic/m39-z80-integration`

## Goal and build selection

Connect the tested wrapper to the real subsystem while retaining legacy as the
default development fallback for this milestone only. Add target-local
`VAEG_Z80_CORE=legacy|suzukiplan`; never compile both implementations into one
production target. Both choices must build on Linux, macOS, and Windows-MinGW.
Do not flip the default, delete legacy files, replace disassembly, or alter
unrelated FDC, 8255, DMA, main CPU, sound, display, or pacing behavior.

Migrate `iova/subsystem.cpp` only at the approved seam. Preserve the class and
used signatures, eight-bit external ports, acceptance-time acknowledge,
level IRQ, clock behavior, and the callback-stale/return-fresh register mirror.

## State and sleep evidence

All saves occur only after the frontend/core frame call and `Z80C::Exec()`
return. Test same-build-family legacy fixtures and a legal old-emulator save
loading under new, new-to-new round trips, ordinary/HALT/external-WAIT/IRQ/EI
states, reachable zero and negative balance, nonzero last clock, and FDD
activity logically in progress across frame calls. Test a synthetic positive
revision-1 field only as codec coverage; current production `Exec()` does not
return positive credit. Do not save inside execution or callbacks.

Use bounded private trace instrumentation from M34 to record callback mirror
PC, live/return PC, sleep assertion, ATN wake, WAIT release, and IM0 bytes only
at actual acceptance. Do not change `0x1732` or `0x700e` unless trace evidence
proves preservation impossible; any correction needs focused tests and the
bug-fix ledger.

Create `docs/modernization/z80-integration.md` with selection commands,
normalized old/new traces, state results, clock deltas, sleep evidence, and
unresolved differences. Never commit private ROM/disk data or logs containing
it.

## QA and human gate G39

Public: invariants, both three-platform builds, all CTest/smoke, wrapper/ZEX,
and bounded differential tests. Maintainer-local for both selections: clean
VA/V3 boot, bundled demo, OS operations, FDD read/write, timing-sensitive disk,
normal VA idle, Sorcerian idle, ATN/8255 wake, legacy-save-to-new load during
FDD activity, repeated reset, and model changes. G39 requires explicit
maintainer confirmation under `suzukiplan`; build/ZEX alone is insufficient.
Push and report exact SHAs/results, then stop.

## M39 implementation record

`VAEG_Z80_CORE` is a target-local CMake cache selection with exactly
`legacy` and `suzukiplan`; the default is `legacy`. The production target
compiles only the selected implementation. The new choice uses the M37 wrapper
and revision-1 codec without changing the vendored tree. The existing legacy
disassembler remains compiled for both selections through a separate callback
bridge; M40 work has not started.

ROM-less production-seam tests exercise ordinary execution, public mirror,
acceptance-time acknowledge, SLEEP_HACK/WAIT wake, retained and new state,
codec failure propagation, EI bit 2, signed clock fields, and a single
production port-`0xf4` event across a save/load boundary. Public CI is a
legacy/suzukiplan matrix on Linux GCC/Clang, ASan/UBSan, native hosted Windows,
and native hosted macOS. Standalone ZEX and differential conformance remains a
single independent job because those targets do not use the production
selection.

The private manifest is
[`docs/modernization/z80-private-integration.md`](../../modernization/z80-private-integration.md).
No private asset was available in the agent workspace, and the four known
untracked paths were not used. G39 cannot pass on public evidence alone; stop
at this gate until the maintainer records the required dual-core boot, FDD,
SLEEP_HACK, WAIT, and state results.

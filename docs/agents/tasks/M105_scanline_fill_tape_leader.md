# M105 - 15 kHz scanline fill and the tape leader sound

Status: **in progress**

Series: V3 series (scanline fill) with a V1/V2 cassette follow-up
(maintainer decision 2026-10-07). Branch
`topic/m105-scanline-fill-tape-leader` off `main` at
`2508ccf47e6a10d9c2b67d1fad62b5a3c7522491`. Commit prefix `M105:`. The CPU
speed gap found in M104 moves to M106.

## Goal

1. **15 kHz scanline fill.** At 15 kHz (non-interlaced) vaeg shows each
   line on the even raster of a pair and leaves the odd raster black, as a
   CRT shows its scanline gaps. An LCD that accepts 15 kHz doubles each
   line instead (maintainer observation, M104 photographs). Add a monitor
   setting: gaps (CRT, default, the current picture) or filled (LCD), saved
   in the configuration. Interlaced modes and 24.8 kHz are unchanged.
2. **Tape leader sound** (vaeg cassette extension, C10). When the motor
   starts for reading a raw or T88 image, play 1200 Hz for one second and
   then 2400 Hz for one second before the data, and hold the data back for
   those two seconds so that BASIC prints `Found` after the sound, as the
   maintainer remembers a PC-8801 ("low, then high, then Found"). With
   fast load (`CMT_Fast`) there is no leader sound and no delay. Saving is
   unchanged. `[POLICY]` (maintainer memory; no document at hand).
3. **Emulation speed** (maintainer request, 2026-10-07): a slider in the
   Emulate menu from 10 % to 400 % of real time with No Wait (full speed)
   at its right end; No Wait leaves the Screen menu.

## Gate G105 (human)

Standard V3 gate unchanged, plus: at 15 kHz the new setting fills the
scanline gaps and the default keeps them; loading a tape without fast load
plays low then high before `Found`; with fast load it loads at once. The
speed slider slows and speeds the guest and its right end runs at full
speed.

## Implementation progress

- 15 kHz scanline fill: Emulate > モニタ, "15 kHz 走査線: 隙間あり (CRT)"
  (default) or "埋める (液晶)", saved as `Monitor15kHzFill`. Romless test
  composes a 15.98 kHz frame and checks the odd raster (gap, or a copy of
  the even raster); it fails with the fill disabled. Headless G256 at
  15 kHz shows the gaps by default and none when filled.
  [be71480c](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/be71480cb438b9c368d8364c5d58f92bd416eb28).
- Tape leader (decision C11): romless test checks that the data are held
  back, the zero crossings of the first and the second second (1200 and
  2400 Hz), the first byte after the leader, and no leader with fast load;
  it fails with the leader or the tone change disabled. Headless V2 BASIC
  `LOAD "CAS:"` without fast load prints `Found` 110 frames (1.95 s at
  56.4 Hz) later than without the leader.
  [ef85911c](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/ef85911cabc4e92a6bb39eb35403b90abc02af41).
- V480PAT `F` (640 dots), `G` (320 dots doubled, 24.8 kHz) and `J` (320
  dots, 15 kHz) sweep frames near 60 Hz, with `Q` (bottom 1, sync 1) and `P`
  (bottom 2, sync 4). `[MEAS]` On the PC-88VA2 every entry was displayed
  and the monitor read-outs match the computed rates with `VS` as written
  (`pc88va-video-modes.md` section 12.8): 59.25 Hz for 640 x 400 and 320 x
  200 doubled with top 17, bottom 1, sync 1; 60.1 Hz for 640 x 394 and
  320 x 197 doubled; 59.9 Hz for 224 lines at 15 kHz.
- `VS` below 4 is now counted as written in the frame length (ledger):
  [62690c08](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/62690c0883d8aba19e1da70b40b0678f60374ef6).
- Emulation speed: `timing_setspeed` scales the frames due per host
  millisecond (romless test: 10, 50, 100, 400 % and clamping; fails with the
  speed ignored); the Emulate menu slider sets it and No Wait at its right
  end. A release build ran the VA2 ROM screen at 28.20, 56.41, 112.81 fps
  at 50, 100, 200 % and 572 fps with No Wait.
  [087c0b07](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/087c0b0715a01b87a84d76b98eecb5718a8f9892),
  [cc7c95ac](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/cc7c95ac5a23d6564107e88917250689faa496c2).
- `[MEAS]` (maintainer, real VA, 2026-10-07) In V1/V2 mode at 24 kHz the VA
  shows 200-line graphics without scanline gaps (each line on both rasters)
  and the text in a clean 8 x 16 font, unlike a PC-8801's 24 kHz monitor,
  where 640 x 200 graphics show gaps and text does not. vaeg matches the VA:
  a V2 N-88 BASIC `LINE ...,BF` box is drawn without gaps and the text uses
  the 16-raster font. No change needed.

# M98k - Bring up the isolated 320x200 8-bpp guest

Status: **automated VAEG candidate `6ed575dedc5da8827704c33a274ac72e480ce420` passed; G98k pending**

Branch: `topic/m98k-zundamon-guest-bringup`

Starting commit: `8b8c5ceeac5445ba1eb0d3aa804974db09de6809`

Implementation commit: `6ed575dedc5da8827704c33a274ac72e480ce420`

Commit prefix: `M98k:`

Gate type: **human/VAEG after fail-closed automated capture validation**

## Goal

Build the smallest bootable guest proof for the M98 display path. Enter the
proven 320x200 G0/G1 8-bpp configuration, draw a static nonzero G0 background,
and submit exactly one SGP command list containing one transparent BITBLT of
one built-in 16x16 synthetic marker to G1 at `(152, 92)`. Keep the completed
image static after the bounded SGP completion wait.

M98j remains closed. M98k inherits its public/private boundary and host-side
pipeline authority, but M98j contains no guest boot implementation. The guest
mode, composition, SGP, build, local-disk, and VAEG launch conventions come
from the existing `demos/sgp-pseudo-sprite/256/` and local demo workflows.

## Fixed guest contract

- Use a 16-bit DOS `.COM` program below 64 KiB.
- Select video mode `e00eh` with G0/G1 pixel-size word `0808h` through
  `INT 8fh`, matching the established 256-color demo.
- Select G1 over G0 through compose value `0034h`, palette-compose value zero,
  and direct-color compose value `0089h`.
- Treat every 8-bpp byte as one deterministic `GGGRRRBB` direct-color entry.
  This defines all 256 byte-to-RGB entries; do not invent a programmable
  palette-RAM path that the reference demo does not use.
- Keep G0 opaque and make only G1 value zero transparent.
- Configure FB1 as a 320-byte-pitch, 400-line backing surface with a 200-line
  display window. M98k uses only page A at SGP address `0220000h` and DSA
  `0020000h`; page exchange belongs to M98o.
- Fill G0 with a deterministic, entirely nonzero checkerboard using ordinary
  CPU GVRAM writes.
- Build one SGP list that clears the visible 64,000-byte G1 page and performs
  one 16x16 transparent BITBLT from conventional guest memory to `(152, 92)`.
- Use SGP BITBLT mode `0105h`. Wait for idle before submission and completion
  afterward with the reference demo's finite polling bounds.
- Publish page A only after the SGP list completes. Do not submit another SGP
  list in the idle loop.
- Expose stable English console messages and fixed register values at a
  once-per-VBLANK idle checkpoint so the debug harness distinguishes mode
  initialization, SGP completion, settled state, and failure.
- ESC may restore the saved video and memory-map state and exit. It is the
  only guest input; there are no animation or runtime controls.

## Synthetic marker

- Width and height are exactly 16 pixels.
- Row stride is exactly 16 bytes, with zero padding bytes per row.
- Value zero is transparent.
- The marker contains a one-pixel border, a diagonal, and an off-center filled
  block using at least three distinct nonzero `GGGRRRBB` values.
- The complete 256-byte marker is repository-owned source data embedded in the
  `.COM`; it is not derived from `orb_raytrace8_24.inc` or any local input.

## Build, disk, and capture

- Add a script-relative NASM build below `demos/zundamon-orbit/256/`.
- Add a local-only bootable-D88 builder that clones an explicitly supplied
  bootable PC-Engine 2HD template, installs `ZUNDORB.COM`, refuses overwrite,
  and leaves both template and output untracked.
- Add one VAEG runner using explicit executable, ROM-directory, template, and
  new output-directory arguments. It must use `--no-cfg`, `--no-bkupmem`,
  dummy SDL, the current debug harness, and deterministic guest-frame bounds.
- Capture two consecutive appearances of the settled idle checkpoint. Each
  capture includes registers, the complete 256-KiB GVRAM image, and the
  composed screen.

## Host oracle

Use only the Python standard library. Fail closed unless it proves:

1. both register captures report the fixed 320x200/8-bpp/completion signature;
2. both complete GVRAM captures are byte-identical and exactly 256 KiB;
3. G0 contains the expected nonzero checkerboard;
4. G1 page A is zero outside one exact 16x16 marker at `(152, 92)`;
5. marker rows, 16-byte stride, zero transparency, and all expected nonzero
   values match exactly;
6. the marker has one occurrence, the expected nonzero-pixel count and bounding
   box, and no second copy in the 320x400 G1 backing surface;
7. the debug event chronology reaches two settled captures without a timeout;
8. the composed captures are byte-identical, nonempty, and not all black; and
9. static source checks find no external asset, BMS, EMS, XMS, scaling,
   animation, or multi-instance path.

Focused negative tests must begin from a passing synthetic capture fixture,
apply one mutation, and assert one stable error code.

## Out of scope

- External image or atlas loading.
- BMS, EMS, XMS, bank selection, or extended-memory caching.
- Scaling or any scale-atlas traversal.
- Animation, rate selection, page exchange, or multiple instances.
- Private artwork, ROM extraction, disk analysis, or sprite decoding.
- Emulator changes or host-rendered substitution for guest output.
- Physical-PC-88VA conformance or timing claims.

```

## Acceptance

The guest build and local bootable disk are reproducible from clean generated
output. One bounded SGP list completes and leaves one exact embedded marker on
G1 at `(152, 92)` over the expected nonzero G0 background. The indexed GVRAM
oracle and two-frame stability checks pass, the rendered captures are stable
and non-black, diagnostics distinguish failure from completion, and no private
or generated payload enters Git.

Automated success produces an M98k VAEG candidate. G98k remains a human gate
and passes only when the maintainer explicitly states that it passed. Stop at
G98k; M98l remains unassigned.

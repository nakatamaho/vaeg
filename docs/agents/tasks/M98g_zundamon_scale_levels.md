# M98g - Generate exactly 30 deterministic scale levels

Status: **G98g machine gate passed on 2026-08-31; 30-level contract revalidated by M98j; `LOCAL_SCALE_SET_PASS`**

Branch: `topic/m98g-zundamon-scale-levels`

Commit prefix: `M98g:`

Gate type: **machine-verifiable public fixture; optional local integration status**

## Goal

Generate exactly 30 deterministic center-sampled nearest-neighbor scale
levels from the M98f VA8 crop, preserve transparency and every sampled byte,
and project the approved anchor without introducing the final atlas or BMS
packing contract.

## Geometry contract

For levels `i=1..30`:

```text
width(i)  = max(1, (source_width  * i + 15) // 30)
height(i) = max(1, (source_height * i + 15) // 30)
pitch(i)  = (width(i) + 3) & ~3
```

For target coordinate `t`, source size `s`, and target size `d`, sample:

```text
source(t) = min(s - 1, ((2 * t + 1) * s) // (2 * d))
```

Project a source anchor coordinate `a` with:

```text
anchor(a) = min(d - 1, ((2 * a + 1) * d) // (2 * s))
```

Level 30 must reproduce every source pixel exactly. Retain all 30 descriptors
when adjacent small levels have duplicate dimensions.

## Required changes

- Add a standard-library scale generator that invokes the validated M98f
  conversion path directly from the generic local bundle.
- Store rows top to bottom with zero bytes from width through four-byte pitch.
- Concatenate frames in increasing level order, inserting only zero bytes so
  every frame begins at a 16-byte-aligned stream offset.
- Emit an intermediate `scales.va8` stream and deterministic private
  `report.json` only in a new explicitly supplied output directory.
- Record exactly 30 descriptors with level, dimensions, pitch, projected
  anchor, stream offset, and payload length.
- Keep CLI success and failure output free of paths, filenames, source or
  target geometry, anchors, pixels, byte counts, descriptors, and hashes.
- Add independent-oracle tests covering all pixels of all 30 public-fixture
  frames, including duplicate dimensions, row padding, frame alignment,
  level-30 identity, anchor bounds, and exact stable failure codes.

## Private boundary

The local input, VA8 pixels, scale stream, report, dimensions, anchors,
descriptors, sizes, and identities remain untracked. Tracked text may record
only the neutral `LOCAL_SCALE_SET_PASS` status.

## Out of scope

- Freezing an atlas header or descriptor binary format.
- CRCs, BMS bank assignment, bank-boundary padding, guest code, VAEG, or
  physical-machine work.
- Runtime interpolation, dithering, rotation, or changes to the G98e-approved
  source and anchor.

## Machine checks

```sh
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/vaeg-m98g-pyc \
  python3 demos/zundamon-orbit/tools/test_zundamon_orbit_scales.py

python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py
git diff --check
```

## Acceptance

The public fixture produces exactly 30 ordered descriptors, monotonic
dimensions, preserved duplicate levels, an exact full-size level, and payloads
matching an independent center-sampling oracle. Every row and frame-alignment
padding byte is zero, anchors remain in bounds, focused failures reach exact
codes, outputs reproduce byte for byte, inputs remain unchanged, and CLI
diagnostics remain path-redacted. Repository and privacy checks pass. A
separately approved local bundle may report only `LOCAL_SCALE_SET_PASS`. This
is a machine gate. Stop at G98g; M98h remains unassigned.

# M98e - Approve crop, transparency, and anchor

Status: **G98e human gate pending**

Branch: `topic/m98e-zundamon-crop-anchor`

Commit prefix: `M98e:`

Gate type: **human/local**

## Goal

Generate deterministic private previews from the validated M98d bundle so the
maintainer can approve the exact crop, transparency result, and visual pivot
without publishing the input or its identifying metadata.

## Required changes

- Add a standard-library preview tool that consumes the M98d bundle without
  modifying it.
- Write only to a new explicitly supplied output directory.
- Emit a full-source crop/anchor overlay, an unmodified nearest-neighbor crop
  preview, and a crop-relative anchor overlay.
- Keep preview filenames neutral and keep the generated files outside Git.
- Keep CLI success and failure output free of input/output paths, filenames,
  dimensions, crop coordinates, anchor coordinates, colors, counts, and
  hashes.
- Add synthetic tests for exact crop pixels, overlay positions, deterministic
  output, source immutability, bounded integer preview scaling, overwrite
  refusal, and path-redacted diagnostics.

## Private boundary

The local manifest, source image, palette, crop and anchor values, preview
images, and their identities remain untracked. The tracked report may state
only whether a neutral local preview is ready and whether the maintainer has
passed the gate.

## Out of scope

- Changing source pixels, palette entries, or transparency rules.
- Claiming that an unreviewed crop or anchor is approved.
- VA color conversion, scaling-atlas generation, guest code, VAEG, or physical
  machine work.

## Machine checks

```sh
PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX=/tmp/vaeg-m98e-pyc \
  python3 demos/zundamon-orbit/tools/test_zundamon_orbit_crop_preview.py

python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py
git diff --check
```

## Human acceptance

The maintainer inspects all three untracked previews and confirms that:

1. the crop selects exactly the intended subject and excludes unrelated
   components and unnecessary border;
2. transparency removes only the intended background;
3. the unmarked crop contains no contamination or clipped intended pixels;
4. the anchor marks the approved stable visual pivot; and
5. the source bundle remains unchanged.

Only the maintainer may state `G98e passed`. Until then, report
`G98e HUMAN GATE PENDING` and stop. Do not begin M98f.

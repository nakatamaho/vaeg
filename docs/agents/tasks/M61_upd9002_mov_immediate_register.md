# M61 — Correct C6/C7 register-form MOV-immediate execution

## Mandatory preparation

Before doing any work:

1. Read `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read `docs/agents/ROADMAP.md` and `docs/agents/CONVENTIONS.md`.
3. Read `docs/agents/UPD9002_SEMANTICS_MIGRATION.md`.
4. Read this task and every report from prerequisite gates.
5. Run `git status --short`; use a clean dedicated worktree at the exact approved predecessor SHA.
6. Record the starting branch, SHA, remote, tool versions, and verified SST corpus identity.
7. Resolve the approved predecessor from the maintainer-approved report; never infer it from HEAD,
   a branch tip, a mutable tag, or milestone numbering.
8. Execute this milestone only and stop at its candidate gate.

All newly authored source, comments, identifiers, commit messages, test names, schemas, and
repository documentation must be in English.


## Predecessor and identifiers

Prerequisite: G60e explicitly approved and fresh ranking confirms the M59 population.

Branch: `topic/m61-upd9002-mov-immediate-register`

Commit prefix: `M61:`

Gate: `G61`

## Goal

Correct only the C6/C7 register-destination defect proven by M59. Do not treat F7 `/2` as the same
primitive.

## Evidence-bound scope

M59 established:

- every C6/C7 memory form passed;
- every C6/C7 failure was a register form whose actual destination remained initial;
- apparent register passes included value coincidences;
- no unexpected FLAGS changes;
- F7 `/2` failures were a distinct low-memory word-path defect.

Reverify those exact properties in the current target-policy epoch before editing.

## Required work

- Fix register-form dispatch/execution for C6 and C7 only.
- Add focused tests that cannot pass by initial/immediate value coincidence.
- Preserve all memory forms, FLAGS, instruction length, IP, prefixes, and termination.
- Do not modify generic EA logic, F7 `/2`, DIV/IDIV, or target classification.

## Gate G61

Every applicable non-coincidental C6/C7 register form is green; all memory forms and unrelated
opcodes retain exact approved results. Full profiles, ratchet artifacts, and deterministic evidence
are required.

Write `docs/agents/reports/m61_upd9002_mov_immediate_register.md` and stop.

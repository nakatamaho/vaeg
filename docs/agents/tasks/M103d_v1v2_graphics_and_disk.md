# M103d - V1/V2 graphics and disk BASIC

Status: **in progress**

Series: V1/V2 mode (ADR-0016). Branch `topic/m103d-v1v2-graphics-disk`
off the integration branch `topic/v1v2-mode` at `main`
`c16ef9cf44f2bc0bbd9cf0f7b28a5ac30899fd71` (M103a–M103c merged). Commit
prefix `M103d:`. Plan and hardware model:
[`docs/modernization/v1v2-mode-plan.md`](../../modernization/v1v2-mode-plan.md).

## Goal

N88-DISK BASIC V2, booted automatically from V2 media as in M103b/M103c,
is usable with its graphics statements and disk commands: `LINE`,
`CIRCLE`, `PSET`, `PAINT`, `POINT`, `COLOR`, `SCREEN`, `CLS` draw and
display as on the real machine, and `FILES`, `SAVE`, `LOAD` and `KILL`
work on a writable image.

## Background (established before implementation)

Sources: `[VA-TM]` BNN manual (port map, ch. 4 display, ch. 8 V1/V2 mode)
and the electronic technical manual (`tekumani`, same register text);
`[X88000]` X88000 1.5.3 (public domain) as a behavioural reference for
PC-8801 semantics, re-implemented without copying code; `[ROM]` traces
and disassembly of the VA2 ROM (local, not committed).

- `[VA-TM]` Port 32h bit 6 GVAM selects independent (0) or extended (1)
  GVRAM access and is forced to 0 in V3 memory mode. Ports 34h and 35h
  are documented as OUT-only and V1/V2-only: 34h holds a two-bit ALU
  operation per plane (00 reset, 01 set, 10 invert, 11 no operation;
  plane n uses bits n and n+4); 35h bit 7 GAM maps GVRAM (1) or main RAM
  (0), bits 5–4 GDM select the write data (ALU output, read data, plane 1
  → plane 0, plane 0 → plane 1) and bits 2–0 the read comparison data.
- `[VA-TM]` §8.3: V1/V2 uses multiplane mode, graphics screen 0 only,
  640 dots, 200 lines with a 15 kHz CRT and 400 lines with 24.8 kHz; each
  plane's 16 KiB is A4000h–A7FFFh of V3 plane n, mapped at 1C000h–1FFFFh.
- `[VA-TM]` Port 31h (OUT, V1/V2 only): bit 4 PM00 (1 or 3 bits/pixel),
  bit 3 GDEN0 (graphics display enable), bit 2 RMODE, bit 1 MMODE, bit 0
  VW1 (400 or 200 lines). PM00, GDEN0 and VW1 are the names of GrRes
  (102h) bit 0 and GrMode (100h) bits 15 and 1.
- `[VA-TM]` 10Ch PLTM2 = 0 selects the palette mode from 32h PMODE and
  31h PM00 (0/0 → mode 1, 0/1 → mode 2, 1/0 → mode 0, 1/1 → mode 2);
  §8.4.2 lists the same four V1/V2 cases. 110h bit 6 88MD selects the
  graphics display circuit's V1/V2 mode and bits 3–0 GnSW the planes of
  multiplane 1 bit/pixel mode.
- `[VA-TM]` ch. 4 §2.1: in multiplane 1 bit/pixel mode the OR of the
  switched-on planes is merged into the text screen's character-generator
  data, treated as text and decorated by the text attributes
  (pixel = P0 | P1 | P2 | P3 | text). `[X88000]` shows the same PC-8801
  monochrome rule (graphics dots take the text cell's colour and reverse).
- `[VA-TM]` §8.4: palettes (54h–5Bh) and the background colour (52h) are
  emulated by the ROM through the I/O trap; the 8801 background colour
  becomes the VA backdrop colour.

## Scope

1. **Extended GVRAM access.** GVAM (32h bit 6, read back in 88 mode),
   34h/35h, ALU writes, latch and comparison reads, GAM mapping of
   C000h–FFFFh, and its interaction with the independent planes and the
   88-mode TVRAM window. Saved state.
2. **Graphics display.** Port 31h controlling the VA display bits it
   names, the palette mode chosen by PLTM2 = 0, colour (3 bits/pixel)
   display at 200 lines, monochrome (1 bit/pixel) display merged with
   text, and 400-line monochrome where the machine provides it.
3. **Disk BASIC.** `FILES`, `SAVE`, `LOAD`, `KILL` under V1/V2 on a
   scratch writable image; fix only what fails.
4. **Tests.** Romless unit tests for the ALU and the port 31h/PLTM2
   behaviour; the private-media acceptance test extended to a graphics
   statement and a disk round trip.

Out of scope: sound under V1/V2, V1 mode, PC-8801mkIISR DEMO (M103e);
3301 semigraphics, 40-column mode, kanji ROM ports, ERAM (unless BASIC
requires them); timing accuracy (GVRAM wait states).

## Gate G103d (human)

Standard V3 gate unchanged, plus with the VA2 ROM set and V2 BASIC
media: `LINE`, `CIRCLE`, `PAINT` and `COLOR` draw in colour, `SCREEN 1`
(640x200) and `SCREEN 2` (640x400) show monochrome graphics, and on a
writable copy of the media a program survives `SAVE`, `NEW`, `LOAD` and
`RUN`.

## Implementation progress

### Extended access (scope item 1)

- Before the change, `LINE` in V2 BASIC wrote into the text screen and
  `CIRCLE` restarted BASIC. `[ROM]` BASIC's plotting code sets GVAM
  (`IN A,(32h)` / `SET 6,A` / `OUT (32h),A`), selects ALU operations with
  34h, and writes each byte with `OUT (C),B` to 35h = 80h, the store, and
  35h = 00h, so outside those writes C000h–FFFFh stays main RAM (BASIC's
  stack is at E5xxh).
- `[ROM]` The VA2 ROM's text trap handler (`F000:1844`, `F000:1CE5`) saves
  32h, 34h, 35h and 5Ch with `IN`, sets port 152h bit 14 for its V3-mode
  work, and restores them with `OUT` (`F000:18A6`). vaeg returned FFh for
  34h/35h, so the restore set GAM; the next `LINE` then turned BASIC's
  stack into GVRAM. `[DERIVED]` 34h and 35h read back the last written
  value although the manuals list them as output ports.
- After the change, the GVRAM dump after `LINE`, `CIRCLE` and
  `LINE …,BF` shows the figures in the expected colours, and `POINT`
  returns the painted colours (comparison read).

### Display (scope item 2)

- `[ROM]` The ROM sets the VA display for V1/V2 once (100h = 3062h with
  GDEN0 clear, 102h = 0001h, 106h = 0A89h, 10Ch = 0000h, 110h = 7F47h,
  frame buffer 0 at 10000h with 140h-byte pitch, 200 lines); BASIC then
  only writes 31h (19h in colour mode). Treating 31h's PM00, GDEN0 and
  VW1 as aliases of the VA bits displays colour graphics.
- `[ROM]` V3 BASIC and PC-Engine write 10Ch = 0180h (PLTM2 = 1); only the
  V1/V2 setup uses PLTM2 = 0.
- `COLOR f,b` in colour mode: the ROM writes the backdrop colour, and
  graphics colour 0 stays opaque, so the background stays black as in
  `[X88000]`'s colour mode.
- The palette mode follows 10Ch PLTM2: with it clear, 32h PMODE and 31h
  PM00 select the mode as tabulated in the manual. Colour mode is then
  palette mode 2 (text from palette set 1, graphics from set 0).
- `SCREEN 1` selects 1 bit/pixel (31h PM00 = 0) with 110h G0SW–G2SW on.
  vaeg drew nothing in multiplane 1 bit/pixel mode; the graphics raster now
  holds the OR of the switched-on planes, the text renderer records each
  cell's colour after the reverse attribute (before secret and blink), and
  the compositor shows set dots in that colour instead of a separate
  graphics screen. `LINE` and `CIRCLE` in `SCREEN 1` appear in the text
  colour. Blank text frames are no longer skipped while this merge is
  active. Not covered: 320-dot horizontal mode.
- `SCREEN 2` (vaeg's fixed DIP switch selects a 24.8 kHz monitor): BASIC
  writes 31h = 08h (1 bit/pixel, 400 lines) and the ROM only switches on
  planes 0 and 1 (110h = 7F43h); frame buffer 0 stays at 200 lines.
  `[DERIVED]` With 88MD set the display circuit must show plane 0 as the
  upper and plane 1 as the lower 200 lines (the PC-8801 640x400 format, as
  in `[X88000]`); vaeg showed both planes ORed in the upper half and
  nothing below. `LINE (0,0)-(639,399)` and a 150-dot circle now span the
  full screen.

### Disk BASIC (scope item 3)

- Without changes, `FILES` lists the media and, on a writable copy,
  `SAVE`, `NEW`, `LOAD`, `LIST` and `RUN` round-trip a program. The V2
  media itself carries the D88 write-protect flag, so `SAVE` on it
  reports `File write protected`, as it should. `KILL` removes a saved
  file (`LOAD` then reports `File not found`).

### Tests (scope item 4)

- `vaeg_romless_tests`: `test_v1v2_graphics` covers independent and ALU
  writes, the comparison read, the three latch-copy modes, 34h/35h read
  back, GAM switching between GVRAM, RAM and the TVRAM window, port 31h
  (88 mode only), the PLTM2-clear palette modes, the merge condition, the
  1 bit/pixel plane OR and the 88MD 400-line plane layout;
  the V1/V2 state-section test covers `MEM88ALU`. Removing the 34h
  read-back, the 31h alias, the PLTM2 rule or the comparison makes it fail.
- `vaeg_m103b_basic_boot` (private ROMs and media): after `PRINT 1+1` it
  draws `CIRCLE (320,100),60,2:PAINT (320,100),4,2` and counts red and
  green pixels in the rendered BMP (measured about 600 and 11 000), then
  `SAVE`, `NEW`, `LOAD` and `RUN` of a one-line program on the temporary
  copy with its write-protect flag cleared. Stable codes
  `M103D_NO_DISK_ROUNDTRIP`, `M103D_NO_SCREENSHOT`, `M103D_NO_GRAPHICS`
  with one-mutation selftest cases. A run takes about 160 s.

# M55: HOSTFAT GUI, save-state identity, and safety finish

Status: **implementation and automated validation complete; G55 pending**

The maintainer accepted the clean-room M54 replacement at
`e0bafbaa3cc0b12f945e18c231c843fc17ff0392`. M55 starts exactly from that
approved SHA.

## Goal

Turn the accepted M54 read-only block-device prototype into a persistent,
reviewable frontend feature while preserving its immutable snapshot and
write-protect contract. Expand the fixed image to the practical FAT12 limit
without changing the 16-bit PC-Engine block-request LBA contract.

## Authorized scope

- Use this fixed FAT12-max geometry:
  - 1024 bytes per logical sector;
  - 16 sectors per cluster (16 KiB);
  - zero reserved sectors, two seven-sector FAT copies, and 128 root entries;
  - 65,362 DOS-visible sectors in a 65,536-sector backing image;
  - 4,084 DOS-visible data clusters, remaining below the 4,085-cluster FAT16
    threshold;
  - allocation only through cluster `0FEFH`, with the six geometrically
    present tail clusters marked reserved in both FAT copies.
- Report both capacities accurately: the DOS-visible volume is 66,930,688
  bytes (63.830078125 MiB), while at most 66,813,952 bytes (63.71875 MiB) of
  cluster payload can be allocated before directory and per-file rounding.
- The G55 human run disproved the original 2048-byte-sector/32 KiB-cluster
  proposal: a 96 KiB file occupied three FAT entries but PC-Engine copied only
  6144 bytes. Use the 1024-byte-sector/16 KiB-cluster geometry demonstrated by
  the PC-88VA 40 MB SASI layout. The corrected HOSTFAT copied all 96 KiB
  byte-identically and read a marker allocated beyond 60 MiB.
- Document that unpatched PC-Engine reports free space using 2 KiB per free
  FAT entry even though 16 KiB cluster reads work. Its approximately 8 MiB
  `DIR` figure is therefore not the HOSTFAT readable-capacity limit.

- Add an enable switch and host-folder picker to Configure.
- Persist the setting using the portable executable-local/user-state policy.
- Build snapshots without freezing the SDL2/ImGui UI and report progress and
  precise failures.
- Define an explicit unmount/rebuild/reset refresh workflow; never expose a
  changing FAT view to a mounted guest.
- Give each snapshot a deterministic identity and define transactional
  save-state load behavior for matching, missing, and mismatched snapshots.
- Complete canonical-root containment, symlink/reparse-point rejection,
  race-resistant file-copy validation, depth/count/size limits, and diagnostics.
- Add deterministic 8.3 alias generation and an explicitly documented policy
  for host Unicode names that cannot be represented safely.
- Add GUI, state, security, cross-platform, and human regression coverage.

## Hard non-goals

- No host writes, delete, rename, or metadata updates.
- No INT 2FH redirector or dependency on MS-DOS SDA/CDS internals.
- No live sector synthesis from a directory that can change while mounted.
- No silent state substitution when snapshot identity does not match.
- No further geometry change without reporting the observed PC-Engine
  behavior and obtaining maintainer approval.

## Planned G55 human gate

- Configure, persist, restart, rebuild, unmount, and reset the host drive.
- Confirm UI responsiveness during snapshot creation.
- Confirm PC-Engine accepts the 1024-byte-sector FAT12-max BPB and can DIR,
  TYPE, and COPY a file spanning more than one 16 KiB cluster.
- Confirm a marker allocated after at least 60 MiB of preceding file data can
  be copied byte-identically. Note the known approximately 8 MiB free-space
  display rather than treating it as the readable capacity.
- Confirm matching save-state continuation and fail-closed mismatch handling.
- Repeat root/subdirectory reads and host write-protection checks on Linux and
  Windows, followed by the standard V3/VA-demo/OS gate.

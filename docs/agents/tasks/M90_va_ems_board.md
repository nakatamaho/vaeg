# M90: Enable the VA EMS board

Status: **implementation complete; G90 human gate pending**

Predecessor: G89 passed; M89 is integrated into `main` at
`c65853cfd2f5ff5318c1a11fec384961037bfdbb`.

Branch: `topic/m90-va-ems-board`

Commit prefix: `M90:`

Candidate gate: `G90`

Implementation candidate:
[`624e74a6560effe324acb6d11c5422043547ba66`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/624e74a6560effe324acb6d11c5422043547ba66)

Validation record:

## Goal

Restore the retained EMS page-frame implementation as a configurable PC-88VA
expansion board, provide a reproducible Open Watcom build of a PC-88VA SQEMM
manager, and generate a supplemental disk with the complete EMMVA/SQEMM98/
RDEMS load stack and `CONFIG.SYS` installation template.

## Required behavior

- Expose `Device / EMS Board...` immediately below `I/O Bank Memory...`.
- Keep the existing persisted `ExMemory` key and state-save sections.
- Treat `ExMemory=0` as disabled and values 1 through 13 as installed
  capacity in 1MB units. A clean configuration retains the existing 1MB
  default.
- Apply changed EMS capacity through the normal guest-reset path. Cancel must
  leave the configuration and running machine unchanged.
- Attach the retained `08E1H`, `08E3H`, `08E5H`, `08E7H`, and `08E9H`
  EMS interface to the active VA I/O dispatcher and compatibility dispatcher.
- Preserve four 16KB page-frame windows at `C0000H`, `C4000H`, `C8000H`,
  and `CC000H`; target zero restores the ordinary memory mapping.
- Keep EMS and I/O Bank Memory independently configurable.
- Extend the ROM-less selftest for disabled behavior, VA I/O reachability,
  target/page mapping, capacity bounds, reset mapping, and configuration
  round trip.
- Update `tools/pc88va/build-softlib-archive-disk.sh` to retain the verified
  EMMVA15A and RDEMS152 archives and extract their redistributable drivers and
  documentation to appropriate supplemental-disk directories.
- Build SQEMM98 MAX from pinned upstream source with the pinned Open Watcom
  image. Implement the VA target/page protocol, preserve 1 through 13MB
  capacity detection, and validate the generated DOS character device.
- Route all SQEMM98 initialization, success, and error messages through the
  PC-Engine Text BIOS `INT 83H/AH=02H` service. Do not use IBM `INT 10H` or
  DOS `INT 21H/AH=09H` for those messages.
- Install `EMMVA01.SYS`, `SQEMM98.SYS`, `EMMVA02.SYS`, and `RDEMS.SYS` on
  the supplemental disk and create root `CONFIG.SYS` in that exact load
  order. Document that the data-only disk supplies an HDD-install template.
- Build media only from a disposable copy of the maintainer-supplied
  PC-Engine 1.1 source D88; never modify or track the source D88 or generated
  media.
- Document the hardware model, EMMVA/SQEMM98 installation order, RDEMS
  dependency, source links, Open Watcom build, and generated contents in
  `docs/modernization/pc88va-hdd-software-environment.md`.

## Non-goals and invariants

- Do not add 128KB EMS-capacity increments; M90 uses 1MB units.
- Do not bundle or download a commercial EMM manager such as EMM4J or MELEMM.
  EMMVA remains an adapter; the generated SQEMM98 driver fills the manager
  position between its two components.
- Do not add an emulator-private EMS API, BIOS service, or direct guest-memory
  injection path.
- Do not alter BMS numbering, main-memory capacity, binary payloads, CPU
  semantics, or unrelated storage and display behavior.
- Do not claim that root `CONFIG.SYS` makes the supplemental data disk
  bootable; the disk intentionally omits PC-Engine system files.

## Commit order

1. M90 task and ROADMAP definition.
2. EMS core/VA-I/O connection, GUI/configuration, and automated tests.
3. Supplemental-disk builder and EMS software-environment documentation.
4. M90 validation record and gate handoff.
5. SQEMM98 Open Watcom build, PC-Engine BIOS output, generated `CONFIG.SYS`,
   and refreshed validation record.

## Automated validation

- Run the ROM-less selftest and focused EMS configuration/mapping checks.
- Generate the supplemental disk from a disposable source-D88 copy, validate
  its FAT contents and extracted `CONFIG.SYS`, and compare the source D88
  before and after.
- Build SQEMM98 twice, verify byte-for-byte reproducibility, and run the
  structural driver validator. Confirm one PC-Engine `INT 83H` output path,
  no IBM `INT 10H`, and no DOS `AH=09H` output path.
- Run Linux Debug and CI builds/tests plus the MinGW cross-build.
- Run repository invariant and diff checks.
- Confirm commit scope/order and that no generated binary asset is tracked.

## Human gate G90

From a clean checkout and clean configuration:

1. Complete the standard VA gate: V3 mode, bundled demo, OS boot, and simple
   operations.
2. Confirm EMS Board appears below I/O Bank Memory, defaults to 1MB, accepts
   1 through 13MB, persists, and resets only on applying a change.
3. Copy the generated stack to the boot drive, merge the supplemental
   `CONFIG.SYS`, and confirm that SQEMM98 messages appear through PC-Engine.
   Confirm the configured capacity and distinct data in more than one 16KB
   page.
4. Confirm RDEMS152 loads after SQEMM98 and supports RAM-disk read/write.
5. Enable I/O Bank Memory concurrently and confirm both mechanisms work.
6. Disable EMS Board and confirm normal V3/OS operation remains intact.

G90 passes only when the maintainer explicitly says so.

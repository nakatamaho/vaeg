# M98q - Add page-local dirty-row clearing

Status: **automated VA2 gate passed; maintainer human gate pending**

Accepted M98p gate head: `05df2d2d069f00b8b5d99d80dfc4979d4482757b`

Commit prefix: `M98q:`

Gate type: **automated VA2/VAEG evidence plus maintainer human gate**

## Goal

Replace M98p's steady-state 64,000-byte hidden-page clear with a page-local
dirty-row clear for exactly one public synthetic pseudo-sprite. M98p remains
the byte-correct full-clear golden. Atlas bytes, the `30..1..29` scale
sequence, fixed anchor, transparent BMS-to-G1 draw, page ownership, SGP
completion rule, VBLANK publication rule, and restoration behavior remain
unchanged.

## Fixed clearing contract

Each physical G1 page owns an independent half-open logical rectangle for its
most recently published sprite. Both pages are fully cleared once during
initialization and begin with invalid old-rectangle state. On page reuse,
round the old horizontal interval outward to complete 16-bit words:

```text
clear_x0 = x0 & ~1
clear_x1 = (x1 + 1) & ~1
clear_words = (clear_x1 - clear_x0) / 2
```

Issue exactly one zero-valued SGP CLS for each old scanline, splitting only at
the checked command-list capacity. Complete every old-row clear before the
single transparent BITBLT. Commit the pending new rectangle, swap page roles,
and advance the scale only after SGP completion and a fresh VBLANK low-to-high
edge. A failed transaction publishes and commits nothing.

Release steady state must contain no full-page CLS. The algorithm is limited
to one homogeneous G1 object and must not be generalized to multiple objects.

## Automated evidence

First reproduce the accepted M98p VA2 full-clear identities. Then run two
complete 58-publication cycles for each combination `A/full`, `A/dirty`,
`B/full`, and `B/dirty`. Compare every dirty physical G1 page and composited
frame byte-for-byte with the corresponding full-clear golden. Verify both
page parities, both directions, endpoint reversals, cycle wrap, first use,
page reuse, stale-pixel removal, word-rounded guard bounds, counter
arithmetic, deterministic builds, and the required fail-closed negative
cases.

For each 116-publication dirty run require exactly two initialization full
clears, zero steady-state full clears, 114 dirty rectangles, 116 transparent
BITBLTs, 116 flips, zero mismatches/guard failures/timeouts/errors, and one
cleanup. Record dirty CLS commands, words, and bytes separately from the
116-frame full-clear baseline and make no elapsed-performance claim.

## Human gate

Provide one pristine generated D88. In VA2 the maintainer must confirm the
same centered 30-to-1-to-29 cycle as M98p, no stale silhouette or horizontal
word-rounding streak, a stable anchor, correct transparent holes, no partial
page, no parity difference, no new flicker or tearing, and successful ESC
restoration. Automation cannot close the human gate.

## Non-goals

M98q does not add cadence controls, orbit movement, depth coupling, private
assets, multiple instances, dirty-row interval unions, sound, gameplay,
elapsed-performance claims, or physical-hardware evidence.

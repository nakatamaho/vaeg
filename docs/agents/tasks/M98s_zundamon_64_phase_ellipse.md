# M98s - Add a constant-size 64-phase ellipse

Status: **automated evidence passed; G98s human gate pending**

Branch: `topic/m98s-64-phase-ellipse`

Starting and accepted M98r commit:
`4c5a7724e31cc0a52c8bfe8e827198c1c30a8c37`

Commit prefix: `M98s:`

Gate type: **automated VA2/VAEG evidence plus maintainer human gate**

## Goal

Move the one public marker clockwise around a deterministic 64-phase
screen-space ellipse while using stored scale ID 15 for every render.  The
anchor-space center is `(160,100)`.  Phase 0 is right, phase 16 bottom, phase
32 left, and phase 48 top.  A phase advances only after a complete hidden G1
page is published on an eligible VBLANK edge.

Generate the signed integer table on the host from one canonical fixed-point
unit-circle table.  The guest performs no runtime trigonometry or scaling.
Validate all 64 anchored rectangles before graphics mode and before each SGP
submission.

## Preserved renderer and cadence contract

Keep the complete public 30-descriptor, one-bank atlas, but bind only scale 15
in the release loop.  Preserve independent page-A/page-B old rectangles,
word-rounded dirty-row CLS, two initialization full clears, zero steady-state
full clears, one transparent BMS-to-G1 BITBLT, READY-only hidden-page
publication, and ordinary-mapping/video restoration.

Preserve `/V1` through `/V8`, LEFT/RIGHT cadence selection, SPACE
pause/resume, ESC cleanup, missed-slot retention, debounce, and boundary-reset
semantics from M98r.  UP/DOWN remain inactive.  Pause, misses, divisor changes,
and failed transactions never advance the pending phase.

## Automated evidence

Reproduce M98r before editing.  Regenerate and validate the orbit table twice,
build twice, and compare hashes.  Compare dirty and full-clear output for
`A/full`, `A/dirty`, `B/full`, and `B/dirty`, each over 128 publications.  Run
all eight 64-publication static divisors, opposite-page 128-publication cases
at V1/V4/V8, the selector ladder, pause/resume, missed-slot, bounds, page-state,
and fail-closed negative tests.  Every publication must match an independent
indexed framebuffer oracle.

Generated COM, BIN, D88, traces, captures, reports, and backup memory stay
outside Git.  No private or ROM-derived material may enter tracked files.

## Human gate

Provide one pristine generated D88.  In VA2, the maintainer checks one
constant-size clockwise ellipse for at least two revolutions; no trail,
clipping, flicker, tear, or partial page; unchanged transparency; inherited
cadence and pause controls; inactive UP/DOWN; and normal ESC restoration.
Automation cannot close G98s.

## Non-goals

M98s does not add depth, phase-to-scale mapping, private imagery, image
rotation, multiple instances, UP/DOWN count controls, gameplay, audio,
emulator timing changes, or physical-hardware performance evidence.  M98t
owns depth and 30-level scale coupling.

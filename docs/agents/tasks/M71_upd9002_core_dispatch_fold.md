# M71 - Fold uPD9002 dispatch into the core translation unit

## Fixed predecessor

M71 starts from the formally approved and main-integrated G70 candidate:

`53d47ed500baef247a1be5f3ccc18bdb0c00c0cc`

Approved predecessor gate: `G70`

Branch:
`topic/m71-upd9002-core-dispatch-fold`

Commit prefix: `M71:`

Candidate gate: `G71`

Report:
`docs/agents/reports/m71_upd9002_core_dispatch_fold.md`

Do not start M72. Do not merge M71 to `main` before G71 approval. Do not
declare G71 passed.

## Scope

M71 is a source-organization cleanup for the active uPD9002 core. It removes
the obsolete split between the core and dispatch construction files now that
the active CPU no longer shares a 286 implementation.

M71 must:

- remove `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.c` as an independent compilation unit;
- remove `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.h`;
- move the dispatch constructor, dispatch tables, prefix handlers, V30-era
  replacement handlers, and `upd9002_core_step()` into
  `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_core.c`;
- remove obsolete `v30` naming from current production symbols and current
  QA metadata, for example `v30_idiv_ea8` becomes `_idiv_ea8`;
- keep externally consumed uPD9002 test seams available through existing
  core-facing headers;
- preserve generated-dispatch validation with the new canonical names.

## Non-goals

M71 must not change uPD9002 instruction semantics, target policy,
SST fixtures, corpus records, state format, memory mapping, TSP/IDP behavior,
Z80 behavior, frontend behavior, or manual-runtime acceptance criteria.

M71 must not revive generic V20/V30/i286/i386 compatibility or reinterpret
`64H`/`65H` as FS/GS prefixes.

Historical approved artifacts remain immutable. If current generated views or
golden files need name-only updates, the report must identify them as M71
metadata refreshes and not as semantic-policy changes.

## Required validation

Run focused validation that proves the fold is behavior-neutral:

- dispatch graph/provenance/support-map validation;
- dispatch normalization runtime test;
- direct uPD9002 harness manifest validation;
- M68 mapped-memory protection;
- M69 IDP status composition protection;
- M70 prefix/string directed and campaign validators available locally;
- protected M65a-M65e tests;
- native non-external CTest subset covering uPD9002;
- normal production build;
- GCC or repository default build;
- Clang build if available;
- MinGW build if available;
- repository invariant checks for milestone IDs, encoding, EOL, path case;
- `git diff --check`.

Unavailable platform checks must be reported with the command, exit status,
and missing dependency or platform.

## Closure

The final M71 report must include:

- starting SHA and branch;
- commit list;
- files removed;
- files modified;
- naming transition summary;
- confirmation that `upd9002_dispatch.c` and `upd9002_dispatch.h` are absent;
- confirmation that no current production symbol keeps the obsolete `v30`
  prefix in the folded dispatch/core path;
- behavior-neutral validation results and command exit statuses;
- generated metadata updates, if any;
- remaining risks and the G71 human-review checklist.

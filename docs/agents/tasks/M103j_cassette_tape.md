# M103j - Cassette tape (vaeg extension)

Status: **in progress**

Series: V1/V2 mode (ADR-0016), closing milestone. Branch
`topic/m103j-cassette` off `main` at
`98f7eb066c33a24f322658789883d49cb7fcfed8` (M103a–M103i merged). Commit
prefix `M103j:`.

## Goal

Let V1/V2 BASIC load and save programs and data on cassette tape images
(`LOAD "CAS:..."`, `BLOAD`, `SAVE "CAS:..."`), as on a PC-8801
(maintainer request). The VA has no cassette interface, so this is a
vaeg extension, like the N mode.

## Background

- `[VA-TM]` Ports 20h/21h are the µPD8251 for RS-232C only; port 30h
  output defines only bit 0 (80CM) and bit 1 (MCM). The PC-8801 shares
  the 8251 with the cassette and selects it, and switches the motor,
  with port 30h bits 2–5. A real VA cannot load from tape.
- `[ROM]` The VA's N-88 BASIC ROM still contains the PC-8801 cassette
  code: writing polls TXRDY (21h bit 0) and outputs to 20h (7FD0h);
  reading takes bytes from a buffer filled by the 8251 receive interrupt
  handler (3167h: `IN 21h` RXRDY, `IN 20h`); `MOTOR` sets port 30h bit 3
  through the shadow at E6C0h (7F20h–7F4Bh), and port 30h bits 4–5
  select the 8251 channel.
- `[X88000]` (behaviour reference only, ADR-0016): channel 00 = CMT
  600 baud, 01 = CMT 1200 baud, 1x = RS-232C; bytes arrive while the
  motor is on and receive is enabled; T88 tape images carry tagged data,
  blank, space and mark blocks.

## Scope

1. **Tape images**: load raw byte images (`.cmt`) and T88 (`.t88`);
   save to a raw image.
2. **8251 cassette channel** in 88 mode: port 30h bits 3–5 (motor,
   channel), receive at the selected baud rate with RXRDY and its 8214
   interrupt, transmit to the save image. RS-232C and V3 unchanged.
3. **Frontend**: a cassette menu (set, rewind, eject, save image) and a
   command-line option for headless tests.
4. **Tests**: a romless round trip of the 8251 path, and a BASIC `SAVE`
   then `LOAD` through a tape image.

## Gate G103j (human)

Standard V3 gate unchanged, plus: a BASIC program saved to tape loads
back; the maintainer's tape images load in V1/V2 BASIC.

## Implementation progress

- Implemented (vaeg extension, decision C10): in 88 mode port 30h bits
  5-4 select the cassette channel of the 8251 and bit 3 the motor;
  received bytes raise RXRDY and the 8214 level 0 request; `[ROM]` BASIC
  waits for port 40h bit 2 (carrier, 7EDFh) before reading, which vaeg
  reports while the motor runs and the tape has data. Transmitted bytes
  are recorded to a raw image. Tape images: raw byte streams and T88 data
  blocks (blank, space and mark blocks are not timed). `CMT_Fast`
  (default on) delivers bytes 16 times faster than the baud rate. Tape
  contents and the recording are not part of state files.
- Frontend: Emulate menu bar > Tape (load or record, rewind, eject, stop
  recording, fast load, position); `--tape` and `--tape-save` for
  headless runs.
- Verified headless: a BASIC program saved with `SAVE "CAS:..."` is
  byte-identical across runs and loads back with `LOAD "CAS:..."` and
  runs; three maintainer tape images (two raw, one T88) load in the
  original VA's ROM BASIC (no disk) and their machine-code parts start.
  Disk BASIC loads the BASIC part of a tape, but programs that need the
  memory disk BASIC occupies do not run there; use the ROM BASIC.
- Romless test: T88 data extraction, carrier, two bytes through port
  20h, recording of a transmitted byte, RS-232C selection leaving the
  tape alone, rewind. It fails if port 20h does not read the tape.

### Tape sound (maintainer request)

- Bytes read from or written to the tape sound as PC-8801 FSK (start bit,
  eight data bits LSB first, stop bit; 0 = 1200 Hz, 1 = 2400 Hz) with the
  2400 Hz carrier between bytes while the motor runs; motor off silences
  it. The sound plays at the real baud rate; with fast load, bytes that
  arrive while one is sounding are skipped. Separate volume: Sound > Tape
  volume (`CMT_vol`, 0-128, default 48). A real-time capture of a load
  shows the carrier, then mixed 1200/2400 Hz during the machine-code
  block. Maintainer check: sounds, but a little high; measured cause: with
  fast load the gaps between sampled bytes were carrier (2400 Hz 74% of
  the time); they now play data (1200 Hz 56%, the data's own ratio about
  59%). Commits [f6f49f57](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/f6f49f57d67a7c3813252b6f530a9015fbe26a86),

### New FDD image sizes (maintainer request, outside the cassette scope)

- FDD > New FDD image also creates unformatted D88 images: 2DD 720 KB
  (80 x 2 x 9 x 512), 2D 320 KB (40 x 2 x 16 x 256, N88-BASIC layout) and
  2D 360 KB (40 x 2 x 9 x 512), every sector present and filled with E5h,
  no file system ("no need to format"). D88 only; the raw loader knows
  none of these sizes. Commits [bc18620f](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/bc18620f71d9cb24574f6fa3b958eef94ff361af),

# M98p - Add the 30-scale full-page-CLS zoom baseline

Status: **automated VA2 evidence passed; G98p human gate pending**

Branch: `topic/m98p-zundamon-scale-baseline`

Starting commit: `543e06114a63c5f7c9f678806d11c221da96ed94`

Accepted M98o implementation: `ddc70c692ecb65066269c9894eb4b14f702fd2d9`

Accepted M98o report head: `71bcdf3467a26dc4eaeb5ca0167fe9e01a26ef20`

Commit prefix: `M98p:`

Evaluated implementation: `4e9c57975a2e3705bc7cb2c29b3b94e5b88f4bea`

Result: [`../reports/m98p_zundamon_scale_baseline.md`](../reports/m98p_zundamon_scale_baseline.md)

Gate type: **automated VA2/VAEG evidence plus maintainer human gate**

## Goal

Extend the accepted M98o hidden-page renderer so the public synthetic atlas
visits all 30 stored scale descriptors. Every update clears the complete
64,000-byte hidden G1 page, transparently BITBLTs one BMS-resident scale,
waits for SGP completion, and publishes only on a fresh low-to-high VBLANK
edge. This is the deliberately unoptimized byte-correct baseline for M98q.

## Accepted predecessor and numbering

The maintainer stated that G98o passed after observing the M98o marker and
successful ESC restoration in VA2 mode. M98l already absorbed BMS mapping,
bounded atlas streaming, and direct BMS-to-G1 transfer; M98m and M98n remain
reserved. M98p does not repeat the obsolete atlas-streaming scope.

## Fixed contract

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| Logical mode | 320x200 VA direct-color 8-bpp |
| G1 backing surface | 320x400, 320-byte pitch |
| G1 page size | 64,000 bytes |
| Atlas | public synthetic `ZUNDORB.BIN` |
| Scale descriptors | exactly 30, implicit IDs 1 through 30 |
| Atlas bank requirement | exactly one 128 KiB BMS bank |
| Source transparency | byte `00h` only |
| Per-update clear | one full hidden-page SGP CLS |
| Per-update draw | one transparent BMS-to-G1 BITBLT |
| Runtime scaling | none |
| Publication | after SGP completion on fresh VBLANK low-to-high edge |

All descriptor dimensions, pitch, scaled anchor, payload size, bank-relative
offset, loaded bounds, and frame CRC must be validated before graphics mode.
The fixed target anchor is `(160,100)` and every destination must fit without
clipping.

## Scale sequence

The exact 58-publication sequence is:

```text
30, 29, 28, ..., 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, ..., 28, 29
```

Endpoints are not duplicated. The sequence advances only after a completed
page is published. Release behavior repeats the sequence until ESC. Bounded
QA runs exactly one cycle and exits without keyboard input.

## Automated evidence

Build the public atlas and guest twice and compare hashes. Run two bounded
VA2 tests with identical content and opposite initial visible pages. Together
they must cover every scale on both physical G1 pages and both directions for
interior scales. The standard-library oracle independently validates the
descriptor table, sequence, anchors, full clears, transparency, source and
destination ranges, page identities, counter invariants, SGP trace, stable
final frames, and deterministic negative cases.

## Human gate

Provide one pristine generated D88. In VA2 the maintainer must confirm the
center-anchored synthetic sprite shrinks from 30 through 1, grows through 29,
and repeats without endpoint pauses, wobble, stale silhouettes, clear-only
frames, page-parity differences, flicker, or tearing. Transparent holes must
show G0 and ESC must restore the guest environment. Automation reports
`G98p: human gate pending` until the maintainer explicitly states
`G98p passed`.

## Non-goals

M98p does not add dirty-row clearing, cadence controls, orbit movement, depth
coupling, private assets, multiple instances, sound, gameplay, performance
claims, or physical-hardware evidence. `REAL_HW_PENDING` remains separate.

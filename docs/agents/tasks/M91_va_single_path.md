# M91 - Native V3 VA single path

Predecessor: approved G90.

Branch: topic/m91-va-single-path

Commit prefix: M91:

Candidate gate: G91

Report: docs/agents/reports/m91_va_single_path.md

Do not start M92. Do not merge M91 to main before G91 approval. Do not
declare G91 passed.

## Goal

Make the native PC-88VA V3 implementation the only active machine path. Remove
the inherited PC-98 compatibility selectors instead of layering VA dispatch on
top of an inactive PC-98 dispatcher.

## Authority and terminology

- Use the maintainer-provided docs/tekumani material as the primary source for
  built-in PC-88VA I/O and memory semantics.
- Use docs/98io only to identify inherited PC-98 functions and same-number
  semantic collisions.
- A matching port number is not evidence of matching hardware behavior.
- Keep VA-supported expansion protocols such as SASI, SCSI, EMS, MPU, and the
  emulator HOSTFAT interface when their ownership is established separately.
- Program symbols, strings, diagnostics, and comments added or corrected by
  M91 must be English. Comments must describe the documented VA function, not
  merely translate a legacy PC-98 label.

## Scope

M91 must:

1. replace the common/VA I/O selector with one canonical VA port map;
2. remove inherited PC-98-only port registrations from mixed device modules;
3. remove the emulator-private memory/I/O mode selector;
4. route public CPU memory access through the VA memory implementation and
   retain explicit raw main-RAM helpers only where the VA map requires them;
5. remove the old PC-98 CGROM/window implementation and retain the VA V3
   014CH-014FH CGROM path backed by fontmem;
6. collapse reset and bind tables to the devices used by the VA route;
7. remove the PC-98 ARTIC implementation at 005CH-005FH; and
8. update focused tests and selftests for an unconditional VA route.

## Explicit deferral

Correct VA1/V2 compatibility mode is a later, separately authorized hardware
milestone. M91 does not replace the removed PC-98 ARTIC handler with guessed
VA1/V2 GVRAM behavior at 005CH-005FH. Native V3 is the only M91 target.

## Non-goals

- Do not change uPD9002 instruction semantics.
- Do not change SGP timing or graphics behavior.
- Do not remove VA-supported expansion boards solely because a built-in-port
  manual does not describe their board-specific or emulator-private ports.
- Do not modify ROM, disk, font, icon, wave, or other binary payloads.

## Validation

Run the repository invariant checks, normal CMake build, CTest, emulator
selftest, focused uPD9002 and device validators, and an available cross-build.
G91 then requires a clean-checkout native V3 boot, bundled VA demo, OS boot,
and simple FDD, storage, keyboard, display, sound, and state-save operations.

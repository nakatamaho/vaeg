# M100g: main RAM and backup-memory synchronization

Owner task: expose installed RAM capacity and optional BIOS backup-memory
synchronization under Menu -> Devices -> Main memory capacity.
Implementation: [fccc71f63310755b89f367cd4119cc8b1d8aba22](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/fccc71f63310755b89f367cd4119cc8b1d8aba22).

## Behavior

- Main_RAM selects 256, 384, 512 or 640 KiB; default 640.
- Main_RAM_Auto selects reset-time capacity/checksum synchronization; default ON.
- Valid existing Main_RAM settings survive migration. Unsupported values warn
  and fall back to 640. A missing automatic-sync key retains the ON default.
- Startup and reset apply the configured RAM limit and backup-memory correction
  before CPU execution. Menu changes are persisted but leave the running RAM
  limit untouched until reset.
- Only the capacity bits and dependent checksum change in existing backup RAM.
  With automatic synchronization OFF there is no emulator capacity correction,
  including when a backup file is missing. Guest firmware may still write it.
- Configuration saving uses a checked temporary write and atomic replacement.
  Short writes, close errors and replacement failures report failure; the menu
  rolls back the setting and displays an error. --no-cfg also rejects persistence.
- The local vaeg.cfg was created with Main_RAM=640 and Main_RAM_Auto=true. It is
  runtime state, not a tracked configuration or private artifact.

## Validation and limits

- Linux Debug executable built successfully with
  `cmake --preset linux-debug -DVAEG_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF` and
  `cmake --build build/linux-debug -j 4`.
- Encoding and EOL repository checks completed without findings.
- Case check reports the pre-existing tracked INSTALL.md and MANIFEST.json;
  this change does not rename unrelated files or alter their allowlist.
- Existing main-RAM selftest setup now explicitly applies the reset boundary.
  No new tests were added; selftests, guest boot, GUI interaction and failure
  injection were NOT RUN. No runtime PASS is claimed.
- macOS and MinGW builds are NOT RUN. No release binaries were copied elsewhere.
- Standard V3/demo/OS human gate remains NOT RUN. No later milestone was started.

# M50 remove approved NP2 286 protected-mode groups

Status: the three and only three groups explicitly approved at G49 have been
deleted. Local preservation validation is complete. Hosted validation and the
G50 human gate remain external to this report; this report does not declare G50
passed and M51 has not begun.

The final report/remote SHA is supplied in the handoff because a report cannot
contain the SHA of the commit that contains itself.

## Identity and scope

- Branch: `topic/m50-upd9002-remove-protected-mode`
- Exact starting and approved G49 SHA:
  `2a21a5264a3830f5a393ed7fbd3fbe1e900f2926`
- Accepted G49 branch:
  `topic/m49-upd9002-protected-mode-reachability`
- Pre-report implementation and QA SHA:
  `303e6cb3f128fbc0300d1a1943887cce36a2944b`
- Final and remote SHA: supplied in the handoff after hosted validation
- Hosted evidence run: supplied after the final pushed SHA completes

The worktree started clean at the exact approved G49 SHA. No reset, rebase,
squash, force push, or M42--M49 history rewrite was performed. M50 changes no
instruction, state, timing, prefetch, DMA, interrupt, exception, memory, I/O,
reset, CPU_SHUT, or REP+0F diagnostic semantics. M51 rename/move work is out of
scope and has not started.

```

No frozen-reference or binary payload path changed. No runtime or serialized
state field was removed.

## Approved, deleted, and deferred scope

The accepted M49 inventory named exactly 52 candidate rows. The deterministic
M50 deletion manifest contains the same 52 stable IDs and no others:

| Approved group | Rows | Deleted/replaced result |
|---|---:|---|
| `M50-PM-ARPL` | 4 | `_arpl` deleted; three slot-63 base targets replaced by `_reserved` |
| `M50-PM-MOV-SEG-EA` | 4 | `_mov_seg_ea` deleted; three slot-8E base targets replaced by `_reserved` |
| `M50-PM-CTS-SYSTEM` | 44 | CTS translation unit/private closure deleted; three slot-0F base targets replaced by `_reserved` |

The manifest identity is:

```text
tools/qa/golden/upd9002_286_deletion_manifest_m50.csv
SHA-256 d037e91bade95c77f120da9aba9f927279e404bf99fc0a4744af1d254a76f2dc
52 candidates
```

All M49 deferred/rejected members remain deferred or rejected. In particular,
M50 retains `v30mov_seg_ea`, `SEGSELECT`, `i286c_selector`, `MSW`, `GDTR`,
`IDTR`, `LDTR`, `LDTRC`, `TR`, `TRC`, `Cpu286StateCompat`,
`Cpu286CompatImage`, the transactional state adapter, `CPU_MSW` I/O, reset,
interrupt/exception logic, CPU_SHUT compatibility, and both M48 diagnostic
handlers. The frozen `i286x/` tier remains untouched.

## Pre-deletion revalidation

Before editing, the accepted M49 graph, source counts, macro uses, state uses,
object relocations, function sections, linker map, tests, and production
symbols were rechecked at the approved starting SHA.

The final six-table graph had no edge to any approved member. The only incoming
production addresses were the nine constructor-base entries later replaced by
placeholders:

```text
i286op/i286op_repe/i286op_repne [0x63] -> _arpl
i286op/i286op_repe/i286op_repne [0x8e] -> _mov_seg_ea
i286op/i286op_repe/i286op_repne [0x0f] -> i286c_cts
```

All nine entries were overwritten by accepted native/diagnostic patches before
publication and before the M46 immutable snapshot. There was no direct caller,
alternate constructor, lifecycle root, callback, I/O root, supported test
caller, or post-construction write. The CTS dispatcher was the only consumer
of `cts0_table` and `cts1_table`; the tables and the direct LOADALL286 case
closed the private translation-unit dependency graph.

The pre-deletion function-section ELF and map at
`/home/maho/vaeg/build/m50-pre-link` contained `_arpl`, `_mov_seg_ea`,
`i286c_cts`, both CTS tables, all non-inlined CTS handlers, and retained
`i286c_selector`/`v30mov_seg_ea`. The map SHA-256 was
`ddb9801d4ca42cb1eb9f978d08ab8ba0b1363897316ec2d2363676dbf62c3085`.
Linker presence was corroborating evidence only; the graph, direct-reference,
state, lifecycle, and diagnostic proofs established deletion safety.

No accepted candidate drifted, became shared, or required deferral.

## Per-group deletion and gates

### M50-PM-ARPL

Deleted `_arpl` only. The three 256-entry base arrays retain their indices and
now use the existing `_reserved` constructor placeholder at slot 63. The final
constructor patches still publish `v30_reserved` at all three native roots.

After this commit, compilation, final graph/support identity, the exact
one-group provenance transition, M46 constructor/immutability QA, M48 522-case
atomic diagnostic QA, ABI/state fixtures, trace, and M43 accepted baseline
checks passed.

### M50-PM-MOV-SEG-EA

Deleted only legacy `_mov_seg_ea`. The three base arrays now use `_reserved`
at slot 8E, while all final roots still receive active `v30mov_seg_ea`.
`SEGSELECT`, `i286c_selector`, and protected state ownership were not changed.

After this commit, the same focused preservation gates passed. Direct and
symbol checks distinguish deleted `_mov_seg_ea` from retained
`v30mov_seg_ea`.

### M50-PM-CTS-SYSTEM

Deleted exactly:

- `i286c_cts` and its declaration;
- `cts0_table`, `cts1_table`, and their 16 entries;
- 13 unique private system handlers: `_sldt`, `_str`, `_lldt`, `_ltr`,
  `_verr`, `_verw`, `_sgdt`, `_sidt`, `_lgdt`, `_lidt`, `_smsw`, `_lmsw`,
  and `_loadall286`;
- private header dependencies `I286_0F`, `I286OP_0F`, `I286_IDTR`,
  `I286_LDTR`, `I286_TR`, and `I286_TRC`;
- `i286c/i286c_0f.c` and its one CMake source edge.

The three base slot-0F entries now use `_reserved`. Final unprefixed 0F still
publishes `v30_ope0x0f`; REPNE/REPE 0F still publish the two M48 diagnostic
stops. The focused runtime gates passed after the deletion. Static source
absence checks were intentionally run again after the deletion commit so Git's
tracked-file inventory reflected the committed file removal; they then passed.

### Deletion size

M50 removes one 288-line production translation unit and 16 function
definitions in total: `_arpl`, `_mov_seg_ea`, `i286c_cts`, and 13 CTS system
handlers. It removes two secondary tables, 16 secondary entries, six private
header aliases/types, one declaration, and one CMake edge. Nine base entries
are replaced in place. Runtime fields removed: zero. Serialized bytes, tags,
sizes, offsets, and padding removed: zero.

Across the four pre-report commits, production paths contain 371 deleted and
15 added lines; audit tooling and deterministic golden evidence account for
the remaining diff.

## Final dispatch graph and construction provenance

The accepted post-M48 final graph regenerates byte-identically:

```text
tools/qa/golden/upd9002_final_dispatch_graph_m48.csv
SHA-256 fe9df28ad3d51cc55235afc3979ada890e86158b294762c15fa33c20d8a800a6
```

The accepted post-M48 support map also remains byte-identical at
`21dd037c3eb11e1674805ad456ef03663f17804affbd7382c8db77291ab25279`.
The M42 and M48 accepted graph/provenance/support artifacts themselves were not
rewritten.

M50 records the intentional source-construction provenance transition in a
new artifact:

```text
tools/qa/golden/upd9002_dispatch_provenance_m50.csv
SHA-256 30246dbd2bbf95b406a6bb05a182d16ea04f56dba48dca73842f5d06b74aae2c
```

Exactly nine rows change, with no final target change:

| Base table | Slots | Old base target | New base target | Final patch target |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `i286op` | 0F / 63 / 8E | `i286c_cts` / `_arpl` / `_mov_seg_ea` | `_reserved` | `v30_ope0x0f` / `v30_reserved` / `v30mov_seg_ea` |
| `i286op_repne` | 0F / 63 / 8E | same | `_reserved` | REPNE diagnostic / `v30_reserved` / `v30mov_seg_ea` |
| `i286op_repe` | 0F / 63 / 8E | same | `_reserved` | REPE diagnostic / `v30_reserved` / `v30mov_seg_ea` |

The constructor remains the single M46 path. Runtime QA reports one successful
construction, one rejected repeat construction, roots
`256,256,256,256,8,8`, and element-wise immutability.

## Post-deletion source, object, linker, and production proof

The deterministic checker fails if any approved member remains active, any
placeholder/final patch changes, any known member is omitted, any group grows,
or any accepted M42/M48 artifact changes unexpectedly. Its negative selftests
cover source resurrection, a changed placeholder, and manifest drift.

Post-deletion production object inventories contain no `i286c_0f.c.o`.
ELF and PE symbol searches contain none of the deleted functions/tables.
The function-section/linker-map build at
`/home/maho/vaeg/build/m50-post-link` likewise contains no approved member;
its map SHA-256 is
`f59b89419d412822d8b0319af03199c5a8b207a9b1cdd4e869f85740cc3c384e`.
It still contains `v30mov_seg_ea` and `i286c_selector`, proving the required
similarly named/shared paths were retained.

Both tests-disabled production caches have `VAEG_ENABLE_TESTS=OFF` and
`VAEG_Z80_INTEGRATION_TRACE=OFF`. Their Ninja graphs and ELF/PE strings contain
no M50 audit source, manifest identity, audit diagnostic, M46 test CLI, or M48
test CLI. The production M48 diagnostic API and exact guest-facing message
remain by design.

## State, reset, CPU_SHUT, and diagnostic preservation

`Cpu286StateCompat` remains 112 bytes and the UPD9002 section remains 16 bytes.
`Cpu286CompatImage`, opaque PE-clear residue, transactional preflight/commit,
MSW.PE rejection, and all field offsets remain unchanged. No runtime field was
removed or converted to opaque-only ownership.

The four-way G41/current matrix reports all booleans true. Payload identities
remain:

| Scenario | CPU286 SHA-256 | UPD9002 SHA-256 |
|---|---|---|
| reset | `6cbd3314a586ccf9c5f1d11a17b8836f76f1deaf10814de8b61ebdf96a792f89` | `374708fff7719dd5979ec875d56cd2286f6d3cf7ec317a3b25632aab28ec37bb` |
| executed-3 | `45d06e424fd332027817ca66db7ed0298e87695cf0cfed5582b7fe1348faa7fe` | `374708fff7719dd5979ec875d56cd2286f6d3cf7ec317a3b25632aab28ec37bb` |
| CPU_SHUT | `7636def12b5f25c39540a1367166394a8308064cce74a15860c62a487a946ff7` | `374708fff7719dd5979ec875d56cd2286f6d3cf7ec317a3b25632aab28ec37bb` |

Reset FLAGS remains f002. The historical CPU_SHUT initializer and FLAGS 0000
result remain exact. The M48 suite reports all 522 F2/F3+0F cases
state-and-memory atomic, and the diagnostic string and pre-mutation stop path
are unchanged.

## M42--M49 preservation

The original M42 immutable artifacts remain byte-identical:

| Artifact | SHA-256 |
|---|---|
| M42 final graph | `e8c8fded6e1f44ef2d74ace93ba1063d64464b217bdd4f9180bf50e86e19df3d` |

The M48 transition manifest remains byte-identical at
`4f3fefe8cbfb20a03364a80a0b917e475d3d545cab8eda6bee8a22c66e2147ee`.
The accepted M49 inventory remains byte-identical at
`f3843cd57b57af8f5baa4a180a7a30c88d628d0b12865d6a4a451a306794c15b`.

The pinned M43 dataset identity remains:

```text
ssts-v20-9efbd02b8ec1a3aad347c2b59672ad25f3bcdb21-
1d2e9c0e14101f05379d938245af68f3219c16f638fce019ad2a1946084930a4
```

The known-gap artifact remains byte-identical at
`11ec1496a96d661c0656720b13939b1ade3448b693b923f8acf36576cd7048c1`,
with 40 selectors and 68,626 exact record hashes.

| Profile | Executed | Pass | Semantic failure | Timeout | Crash | Signature index |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| CI | 166,821 | 156,228 | 10,593 | 0 | 0 | `946268103309f8dc7d442fade21596b46c734f48bf0b1e9e32a18736e5e85597` |
| full empty-prefetch | 1,443,876 | 1,359,547 | 84,329 | 0 | 0 | `50087f8f6b9483ac70ce5e2dc922ab11fade51a58bea9cb72322ef85ef264ec0` |

Both independent `--expect` runs pass. Generated JSON and complete failure
sidecars compare byte-identically with their accepted baselines.

M45 still uses `v30c_step()` as the sole active primitive and has no
CPU_TYPE-controlled execution or `i286c_step`. M46 still has one constructor,
immutable six roots, and no `i286c()`, `v30c()`, `CPU_EXEC`, or `CPU_EXECV30`.
M48 diagnostic/state rejection and M49 accepted evidence remain exact.

## Deviations and remaining risks

- Temporary preset builds under this worktree's small `/tmp` filesystem
  exhausted available space during sanitizer work. Only M50-created build
  directories were removed. Fresh canonical builds completed under
  `/home/maho/vaeg/build/m50-*`; no tracked or user asset changed.
- The first tests-disabled release FetchContent configure could not resolve a
  host in the restricted sandbox. The identical command passed with approved
  network access.
- Before their parent directories were created, the first two state-scenario
  commands failed to save/output fixtures. Fresh task-owned directories were
  created and both commands plus the complete four-way matrix then passed.
- The first Wine initialization attempt could not create its server directory
  under the restricted runtime mount. The same command passed with approved
  Wine runtime access, followed by successful selftest and smoke runs.
- One exploratory invocation of the historical M42-only
  `upd9002_dispatch.py --selftest` compared the current accepted M48 graph to
  the intentionally frozen M42 graph and exited 1. The applicable M48
  transition checker and M50 deletion checker regenerated and verified the
  current graph/provenance/support identities successfully; no accepted golden
  was changed.
- One exploratory SHA command named a nonexistent shorthand known-gap path
  after hashing the three preceding artifacts. The corrected committed path
  produced the accepted SHA, and its recorded counts remain 40 and 68,626.
- Immediately after deleting `i286c_0f.c` but before committing that deletion,
  Git's tracked-file query still listed the path, so two source-absence CTests
  intentionally failed. They passed after the deletion-focused commit and in
  every final GCC/Clang/ASan run.
- Real uPD9002/V52 REP+0F semantics remain unknown. M50 preserves the approved
  fail-closed diagnostic policy and does not assert architectural correctness.
- `SEGSELECT`, `i286c_selector`, protected runtime/serialized state, and other
  shared `I286_*` implementation names remain intentionally. They are active or
  compatibility-owned, not evidence of an incomplete approved deletion. Any
  mechanical rename belongs only to M51 after G50.
- The standard V3 boot, bundled VA demo, OS, media, sound, and save/load gate is
  a human check. This report neither performs nor approves it.

## G50 human-review checklist

- [ ] Confirm only `M50-PM-ARPL`, `M50-PM-MOV-SEG-EA`, and
  `M50-PM-CTS-SYSTEM` were deleted.
- [ ] Confirm nine `_reserved` base placeholders and all accepted final native
  or diagnostic patch targets.
- [ ] Confirm `v30mov_seg_ea`, `SEGSELECT`, `i286c_selector`, protected state,
  CPU_SHUT, and M48 diagnostic behavior remain.
- [ ] Review the exact nine-row M50 construction-provenance transition and
  byte-identical final graph/support map.
- [ ] Review source/object/linker/ELF/PE absence evidence and production
  isolation.
- [ ] Review M42--M49 artifact, M43 signature, state matrix, sanitizer,
  MinGW/Wine, and hosted CI results.
- [ ] From a clean checkout, build and boot V3 mode.
- [ ] Run the bundled VA demo.
- [ ] Boot an OS and verify keyboard input and FDD read.
- [ ] If practical, verify FDD write/readback, Sound Board II, save/load
  continuation, and reset/reboot.
- [ ] Confirm no test log, CLI seam, or diagnostic appears during ordinary
  supported execution.
- [ ] Explicitly approve or reject G50. Do not begin M51 before approval.

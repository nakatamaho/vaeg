# M99r — Harden D3D11 lifecycle

Status: PASS (lifecycle handling and cross-build); Windows runtime deferred

## Lifecycle behavior

The D3D11 presenter now enters `Filtered` when initialized with a valid
filter request and accepts both filtered and pass-through states for present,
resize, and toggle operations. It reads the current HWND client area before
each frame, recreates swap-chain output resources after a size change, and
treats zero-sized/minimized windows as temporarily disabled.

`DXGI_STATUS_OCCLUDED` is a non-fatal no-output result. Device-removed,
device-reset, and driver-internal-error results from resize, upload, or
presentation are reported separately as device loss; the presenter moves to
`Unavailable` and exposes `recover()` to tear down and recreate the device,
swap chain, output resources, source texture, and optional librashader chain.
Recovery retains the bounded preset path and filter choice. Filter history is
restarted after recovery or re-enabling the filter. Teardown is idempotent and
frees the filter chain before the D3D11 device.

```

Result: PASS. Both backend translation units and the complete optional-feature
PE32+ build succeeded. No Windows runtime or D3D11 GPU is available on the
current host, so actual device-loss injection, occlusion, HiDPI/fullscreen
pixels, and hardware recovery remain deferred to G99-3.

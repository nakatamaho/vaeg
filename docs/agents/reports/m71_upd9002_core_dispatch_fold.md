# M71 - uPD9002 core dispatch fold report

Status: M71 implementation candidate prepared for G71 human review. G71 is not
approved by this report.

## Starting point

- Branch: `topic/m71-upd9002-core-dispatch-fold`
- Starting SHA: `53d47ed500baef247a1be5f3ccc18bdb0c00c0cc`
- Approved predecessor: G70 at
  `53d47ed500baef247a1be5f3ccc18bdb0c00c0cc`

## Commit list

- `1b8ba2a8` - `M71: define core dispatch fold cleanup`
- `74423dd0` - `M71: fold dispatch tables into uPD9002 core`
- `caed63de` - `M71: update folded dispatch validation`
- `f3bb9398` - `M71: close core dispatch fold evidence`
- `d08f0917` - `M71: support legacy SST support maps after dispatch fold`

The final branch head is reported in the handoff after the report-update
commit.

## Files removed

- `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.c`
- `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.h`

Both files are removed from the active tree. `CMakeLists.txt` no longer lists
`cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.c` in `VAEG_CORE_SOURCES`.

## Production fold

The former dispatch translation unit is folded into the active uPD9002 core
sources:

- `upd9002_core_step()` now lives in `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_core.c`.
- The canonical root tables now live in `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_mn.c`:
  `upd9002op`, `upd9002op_repe`, `upd9002op_repne`,
  `upd9002op_repc`, and `upd9002op_repnc`.
- The canonical 0F table is `upd9002_ope0x0f_table`.
- F6/F7 division tables remain in `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_f6.c` as
  `c_ope0xf6_table` and `c_ope0xf7_table`.
- The M46 dispatch immutability test seam remains available through
  `cpu/upd9002/cpucore.h` and is implemented against the folded static tables.

## Naming transition

M71 replaces the dispatch-era `v30` handler/table names with canonical
uPD9002 names in the current production path.

Examples:

- `v30_idiv_ea8` -> `_idiv_ea8`
- `v30_div_ea8` -> `_div_ea8`
- `v30_idiv_ea16` -> `_idiv_ea16`
- `v30_div_ea16` -> `_div_ea16`
- `v30_ope0x0f` -> `_ope0x0f`
- `v30_repc` -> `_repc`
- `v30_repnc` -> `_repnc`
- `v30push_sp` -> `_push_sp`
- `v30mov_seg_ea` -> `_mov_seg_ea`

The old canonical implementations that collided with replacement handlers were
not retained beside the new names. They were replaced by the uPD9002 production
semantics that previously entered through the dispatch patch tables.

The tables are intentionally not all placed in `upd9002_core.c`: the relevant
handler macros expand to static functions in `upd9002_mn.c` and
`upd9002_f6.c`. Keeping the tables in those translation units avoids exporting
formerly static handler internals solely for the refactor.

`CPUTYPE_V30` remains unchanged because it is the approved legacy serialized
compatibility byte, not a runtime dispatch selector.

## Current generated metadata

The current dispatch generator now reads the folded static tables directly and
emits canonical table and handler names:

| Artifact | Rows including header | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `tools/qa/golden/upd9002_final_dispatch_graph.csv` | 1,514 | `3203d510afd11982460ad27704ca06d7cf8cf7a58d0abf05c437c5ef520e049c` |
| `tools/qa/golden/upd9002_dispatch_provenance_m42.csv` | 1,297 | `0a615838c943305f629a97e608f3767fb47bacbdc2a843dd805ec68eab25d920` |
| `tools/qa/golden/upd9002_support_map_m42.csv` | 1,553 | `2e0fb98a58cbfea483535fae451b4f632a806d0cde6c21bf5dd8737383950c1e` |
| `tests/upd9002/harness_manifest.csv` | 194 | `1a1afd169ee75195e9c299589e3f3abff742a2f7de19aed887734f8ca199ed55` |

Approved historical G70 artifacts were not rewritten. The M70 validator now
accepts the historical G70 dispatch CSV family as approved evidence while
checking that current folded dispatch regeneration matches the current golden
counterparts.

## Post-push G65m CI support-map compatibility

The hosted G65m CI entry point intentionally runs against the G64 target policy
support map. That generated G64 map still uses the historical dispatch table
family names:

- `v30op`
- `v30op_repe`
- `v30op_repne`
- `v30op_repc`
- `v30op_repnc`
- `v30op_0f`
- `v30ope0xf6_table`
- `v30ope0xf7_table`

The first M71 candidate normalized the SST dispatch resolver to the current
folded `upd9002op`/`c_ope...` table family unconditionally. That made the G65m
CI classifier look up current table names in a predecessor G64 support map and
fail closed with:

```text
g65m-ci-error: 00: no M42 support-map row for ('upd9002op', 0, '-')
```

M71 now resolves the support-map table family from the actual support map
passed to `tools/qa/upd9002_ssts.py`. Current folded maps still resolve through
the `upd9002op` family, while G64 predecessor maps resolve through the
historical `v30op` family. This keeps historical target-policy replay
compatible without restoring production V30 dispatch names.

## Scope audit

No intentional changes were made to:

- target policy semantics;
- SST corpus records;
- state format or state compatibility schema;
- memory mapping behavior;
- TSP/IDP behavior;
- Z80 behavior;
- frontend behavior.

The remaining `V30` spellings in active uPD9002 production files are limited
to `CPUTYPE_V30` state-compatibility checks and messages. They are not current
dispatch table names or handler names.

## Remaining risks

- The change is large because folding a translation unit necessarily moves many
  static handlers and dispatch tables into one compilation boundary.
- Hosted CI has not yet been run for the final M71 branch candidate in this
  report snapshot.
- MinGW was not rerun in this snapshot.

## G71 human-review checklist

- Build from a clean checkout of the final M71 branch.
- Boot in V3 mode.
- Run the bundled VA demo.
- Boot PC-Engine/MS-DOS and verify `DIR A:`, `CHKDSK A:`, multi-screen text
  output, `CLS`, save/load, and Sound Board II.
- Confirm that `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.c` and
  `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_dispatch.h` are absent.
- Confirm that G71 is approved only by the maintainer.

# M99f SDL2 frontend inventory

Status: PASS

This inventory records the pre-M99 presentation boundary used by the portable
SDL2 frontend. It is the input to the backend-neutral contracts in M99h.

## Raw guest framebuffer

- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:41-69` owns the presentation state. The deterministic guest
  surface is `scrnmng.shadow`, a 640x400 RGB565 buffer with one two-byte guard
  at the left of each row.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1456-1475` exposes that buffer through
  `scrnmng_surflock()`/`scrnmng_surfunlock()`; `vram/scrndrawva.c:69-110`
  renders the guest image into it. The unlock uploads the raw pixels to the
  SDL texture.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:928-938` updates the static RGB565 SDL texture. This is the
  stable raw-frame boundary and is independent of the host window size.

## Existing presentation path

- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1066-1126` creates a resizable high-DPI SDL window, chooses
  an accelerated SDL renderer with software fallback, creates the 640x400
  RGB565 texture, and allocates the shadow buffer.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:949-990` calculates the viewport from the drawable output
  size, menu inset, scaling policy, and aspect setting. Window size and
  drawable size are intentionally queried separately for HiDPI correctness.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1477-1550` clears the renderer, copies the guest texture to
  the viewport, and applies the existing scanline/CRT-lite software overlay.
  `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1552-1566` draws GUI/diagnostic overlays and calls
  `SDL_RenderPresent`.
- `sdl2/np2.c:1546-1553` defines the per-guest-frame presentation sequence:
  GUI frame, raw texture presentation, GUI render, and present. The main loop
  chooses whether to draw at `sdl2/np2.c:1625-1735`, so draw skipping and
  nowait pacing are guest-loop policies, not audio/video callback timing.

## Capture and QA boundaries

- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:126-159` reads the final SDL render target for normal
  captures, with a dummy-video reconstruction path for headless runs.
- `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1568-1590` saves the scaled/effected rendered frame, while
  `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1592-1616` saves the raw guest frame. The latter is the
  shader-independent QA artifact; the former is presentation output.
- `sdl2/np2.c:1556-1564` captures after a completed guest frame, and
  `sdl2/np2.c:1595-1601` preserves the ordering of automation, screenshot,
  and exit checks. `sdl2/README.md:121-134` documents the distinction.
- `VAEG_SCREEN_DUMP` is enabled during `scrnmng_create()` at
  `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1112-1117`; the CLI screenshot path uses the same rendered
  capture API. Existing raw TVRAM and GVRAM diagnostic capture paths remain
  outside this presentation boundary.

## Geometry, lifecycle, and threading assumptions

- SDL window resize events are handled on the main loop in
  `sdl2/taskmng.c:262-272`; the stored window dimensions are configuration
  state, while viewport calculation reads current SDL output dimensions.
- Fullscreen/windowed changes and display effects are managed by the same
  `scrnmng` owner. Destroy/recreate releases the texture, shadow buffer,
  rendered capture surface, renderer, and window in
  `sdl2/scrnmng.c:1137-1160`.
- `sdl2/np2.c:2106-2128` initializes the screen before the GUI and guest core,
  and `sdl2/np2.c:2146-2180` runs the guest/presentation loop before orderly
  shutdown. No existing render thread or GPU command queue is exposed to the
  emulator core; presentation is main-thread driven.
- The current SDL abstraction is `SDL_Renderer`/`SDL_Texture` based. No
  OpenGL, Metal, D3D11, librashader, preset parser, or shader resource is
  present in the clean baseline.

## Build ownership

`CMakeLists.txt:288-325` lists the SDL2 frontend sources, including
`sdl2/scrnmng.c`, `sdl2/np2.c`, and the existing diagnostic/capture helpers.
`CMakeLists.txt:563-573` builds and links the single `vaeg_sdl2` executable
against the core, VA layer, common layer, SDL2, and the existing vendored
ymfm/ImGui sources. M99 must keep raw framebuffer capture below any optional
shader stage and preserve the SDL/software fallback when the optional backend
is unavailable.

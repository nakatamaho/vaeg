# M98aa IDA 64-instance animation

Status: **G98aa: human gate pending**

`REAL_HW_PENDING` remains in force. This milestone is a private local
candidate extension and does not make private pixels, manifests, hashes,
paths, binaries, or disk images distributable.

## Authority and scope

- Starting accepted G98z head: `8d0ce6c5696661e7aba66ca5e36bf75760660d71`.
- Branch: `topic/m98aa-ida-64-animation`.
- Implementation commits: `aa910563b56cadd647c2058758e37a3d1f50cf71`,
  `12365710b5d63dc8e53683828851ce35f130cc71`, and
  `ce99d8243267807d59b3fabefb8d70e9014cab52`, followed by corrective
  launch fix `ee65ac701dec5d9d759b3efed245b76cf4686052`.
- Report commit: this report commit; the exact pushed head is supplied at
  handoff and is remotely equal.
- Predecessor: G98z was explicitly passed by the maintainer and its accepted
  head is the starting point.
- Scope: private IDA profile only; public ZUNDAMON behavior is unchanged.
- The later 128-instance extension is not included.

The unrelated pre-existing worktree state was preserved exactly:

## Implementation

The private build selects a capacity of 64 rectangles, draw indices, dirty
interval candidates, and merged intervals. Page-local rectangle offsets and
instance-ID storage use capacity-derived shifts. A four-word (64-bit) seen
mask validates every generated draw permutation (including counts below 64);
the public path retains its original 16-bit code and binary identity. Record
storage remains the accepted 50-byte ABI and uses one shared external atlas.

The private parser accepts exactly `/N1` through `/N64`, rejects malformed and
duplicate tokens, and keeps the existing `/V1` through `/V8` grammar. UP/DOWN
continue from requested state and saturate without wrapping. The private HUD
generator/validator supports 64 fixed two-cell count tiles; the public default
remains 16. Private speed status uses thirteen 0.25X steps from 1.00X through
4.00X, independently of the FPS divisor.

When enabled by the private build, a bounded VBLANK-driven camera demonstrator
steps speed and distance once per nominal 60-edge interval in a deterministic
triangle. Requests still apply only at complete transaction boundaries; no
clear/draw batch is relabelled in flight. A/Z and Q/E remain available for
manual changes. No renderer fork, runtime scaling, extra atlas bank, or
full-page steady-state clear was added.

## Neutral verification

The accepted public guest was rebuilt twice from the unchanged public path:

```text
M98X_GUEST_BUILD_PASS size=52656 runtime_counts=1..16
public guest SHA-256: e0f2111e4da5d0723633f6ac11658fad49f825c2bc6e6346578ac72ff67aa93f
```

The private candidate was built twice from the previously validated local
IDA atlas and 64-count HUD profile. Both builds were 60,848 bytes and
byte-identical. The private output remains untracked. The neutral private
checks passed:

```text
M98H_ATLAS_PASS
M98T_DEPTH_TABLE_VALIDATION_PASS
M98X_HUD_VALIDATION_PASS count_tiles=64
M98AA_PRIVATE_GUEST_BUILD_PASS runtime_counts=1..64
```

The bootable private candidate contains the external atlas and the 60,848-byte
guest; it is available only through the local private build workflow.

## Corrective launch fix

The first 64-instance candidate exited before graphics mode. The demonstrated
root cause was private draw-order validation clearing its four-word seen mask
through the stale BMS `ES` mapping; subsequent phase validation therefore
reported a duplicate even though the generated permutation was valid. The
correction temporarily binds `ES` to the guest data segment for that bounded
clear and restores the prior segment before continuing. The SGP destination
descriptor's fixed four-bit x-word field is also kept independent from the
capacity-derived footprint index, preserving the accepted wire format.

The corrected private guest remains 60,848 bytes and deterministic. VAEG
startup now reaches the complete-frame flip checkpoint for counts 1, 4, 16,
and 64 using the validated private atlas, with the private profile HUD and
rendered instances present. The public guest remains byte-identical to its
accepted M98z identity. The private candidate and its media remain local-only.

Focused host and shell checks passed:

```text
python3 demos/zundamon-orbit/tools/test_m98aa_ida64.py       4 tests OK
python3 demos/zundamon-orbit/tools/test_m98z_orbit_controls.py 15 tests OK
python3 demos/zundamon-orbit/tools/test_m98y_private_profile.py 3 tests OK
sh -n demos/zundamon-orbit/256/build.sh demos/zundamon-orbit/build-local-d88.sh
```

The public binary compares byte-for-byte with the accepted M98z public
identity. The new neutral host test covers all 64 parser values, invalid
forms, 64 unique phase offsets, the 1.00X..4.00X ladder, and source-level
capacity/auto-camera guards. Detailed private framebuffer and timing evidence
stays outside Git; VAEG/VA2 timing is diagnostic only.

## Human gate

The maintainer must inspect the local private IDA64 candidate at counts 1, 4,
16, and 64; verify continuous motion, deterministic speed/distance animation,
no stale or partial page, correct HUD and controls, both page parities, pause,
and ESC restoration. Until an explicit `G98aa passed` statement is recorded,
the milestone remains **G98aa: human gate pending**.

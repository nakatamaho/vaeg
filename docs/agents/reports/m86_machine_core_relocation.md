## Scope and status

M86 starts from the G85-approved main continuation at
[9d4ea365](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/9d4ea3657ca1684ab852b625fb8dfffb4f4372a0).
The implementation candidate was merged to `main` at
[74a5eac8](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/74a5eac8bc0fa145fc0c4bf5ed66e3ff5368c0ae)
after the rename, reference-fixup, and validation commits below.
G86 human validation remains pending.

The implementation is deliberately split into the required layout commits:

- [78572be2](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/78572be2cac1ae314dc50e668dd5b9570a43d9f6)
  moves the active root machine-core files into `machine/` using rename-only
  operations.
- [b04c6203](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/b04c620316b3fccc00d457dab656bccdc9c3d019)
  updates CMake source lists, include paths, active source references, QA
  paths, and current documentation.

## Relocated files

| Area | Files | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Machine runtime | `pccore.c/.h`, `nevent.c/.h`, `timing.c/.h`, `calendar.c/.h` | Moved to `machine/` with no implementation change beyond include paths. |
| Input and events | `keystat.c/.h/.tbl`, `debugsub.c/.h` | Moved to `machine/`; keyboard and event behavior are unchanged. |
| State and scaling | `statsave.c/.h/.tbl`, `clockscale.h` | Moved to `machine/`; state section order, payloads, and clock semantics are unchanged. |

The active CMake source list now names `machine/*`, and the machine directory is
an include search path. Keeping `cpu/upd9002/upd9002_ops.mcr` byte-identical
preserves the M50 protected artifact while still resolving its relocated
`clockscale.h` include. No binary payload, ROM, disk image, or generated asset
was changed.

The following deferred boundaries remain at their original paths:

- `common.h` remains the project-wide type and macro boundary.
- `np2ver.h` remains the release and packaging identity boundary.
- `oprecord.c` and `oprecord.h` remain deferred from the earlier operation
  recording audit.

## Reference and documentation updates

Current C and C++ includes, the CMake source list, QA path assumptions, and
current architecture/decision documentation now use `machine/` paths. Historical
M48-M72 evidence and frozen-reference path names were not rewritten. The move
contains no CPU instruction, VA I/O, storage, timing, keyboard, or state-format
change.

## Verification

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| UTF-8 encoding validator | PASS; 0 violations |
| LF EOL validator | PASS; 0 violations |
| Case validator | PASS; 0 findings |

| `upd9002_m66_identity.py selftest` | PASS |
| `upd9002_m66_state.py --root . verify-m66a` | PASS |
| Protected deletion CTest checks | PASS |
| `cmake --preset linux-ci-gcc` and build | PASS |
| `ctest --test-dir build/linux-ci-gcc --output-on-failure` | PASS; 83/83, external SST corpus test skipped |
| `SDL_VIDEODRIVER=dummy SDL_AUDIODRIVER=dummy ./build/linux-ci-gcc/sdl2/vaeg --selftest --model va` | PASS; all tests passed |
| `cmake --preset mingw-cross` and MinGW build | PASS |
| MinGW artifact | PE32+ `build/mingw-cross/sdl2/vaeg.exe`; SHA-256 `33e60f8e087332dbc4edd7aefa08c26ab56022b2a468ea55cf554d24cbcf9f37` |
| Post-merge MinGW build at `74a5eac8` | PASS; PE32+ `build/mingw-cross/sdl2/vaeg.exe`; SHA-256 `cfa823a83ffe56099c046972566a3799cd5d2f6b2d2fdc65473d7f501a827753` |
| Post-merge Linux-debug build at `74a5eac8` | PASS |
| Post-merge VA selftest at `74a5eac8` | PASS; all tests passed, exit 0 |
| Post-merge repository validators | PASS; case 0 findings, UTF-8 and LF checks clean |

The standalone `upd9002_protected_reachability.py --root .` validator still
reports `post-M48 graph differs from source regeneration` on both this
candidate and the integrated `main` control checkout at `9d4ea365`. This is a
pre-existing golden-graph drift, not a difference in the M86 source move; it is
recorded as an unresolved baseline validation item and was not changed
speculatively in this layout milestone.

## Gate state

M86 implementation and machine checks are complete, and the implementation
was merged to `main` at
[74a5eac8](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/74a5eac8bc0fa145fc0c4bf5ed66e3ff5368c0ae)
at the maintainer's explicit request. The standard G86 human gate has not been
performed and remains required to close M86: use a clean checkout, boot V3
mode, run the bundled VA demo, boot an OS, and perform simple guest operations.

# M98z orbit and camera controls

Status: **G98z: human gate pending**

`REAL_HW_PENDING` remains in force. This report records the bounded public
implementation and automatic evidence; it does not claim physical PC-88VA
throughput or replace the maintainer visual gate.

## Control and renderer contract

The renderer remains 320x200 VA 8bpp (`GGGRRRBB`), G0 background/HUD plus G1
transparent billboards, two physical 320x200 pages, one shared 30-scale atlas
in one BMS bank, complete dirty-union clear/draw transactions, and signed-depth
ascending order with instance-ID tie breaking. The public profile remains
ZUNDAMON; the accepted private IDA profile remains local and untracked. The
effect is a camera-facing 2D billboard orbit, not true yaw/pitch rotation or a
3D model. The 128-instance extension is explicitly deferred to M98aa.

Requested and active projection fields are separate:

```text
requested/active speed index: 0..12, default 3, Q8.8 increments
requested/active distance bias: -4..+4, default 0
requested/active look level: -4..+4, default 0, four pixels per level
requested/active radius index: 0..8, default 4, Q8.8 factors
phase accumulator: 16-bit modulo 64*256
```

`A`/`Z` changes only the speed ladder (0.25X, 0.50X, 0.75X, 1.00X, 1.25X,
1.50X, 2.00X, 3.00X, 4.00X, 5.00X, 6.00X, 7.00X, 8.00X). The SPD tile has
one trailing blank cell before the next status field. `Q`/`E` changes distance and clamps effective scale IDs
to 1..30. `W`/`S` changes look level; W is upward-looking and adds positive
screen-Y bias. `O`/`P` selects radius factors 0.50X through 1.50X from the
immutable base radii with symmetric integer rounding. LEFT/RIGHT retain the
V1..V8 nominal FPS divisor ladder, UP/DOWN retain the 1..16 count ladder,
SPACE pauses, and ESC uses common cleanup. Physical make events are consumed
through the existing one-press BIOS policy, so letter case does not create a
second path and typematic is bounded.

Input updates requested state only. At the next hidden transaction the latest
request is copied into active state, all records/order/rectangles are rebuilt,
the old page-local union is cleared, and the complete frame is drawn. Status
tiles are written to G0 only after the corresponding page/count is published;
G1 and the accepted FPS/count rectangles are untouched. A missed slot retains
the pending frame, visible state, and phase. The Q8.8 accumulator advances only
after complete publication; paused publication does not consume a phase step.

The corrective pass uses the PC-88 keymap values for A (`1Dh`), S (`1Eh`), and
Z (`29h`), and sign-extends the bounded DIST/LOOK values before selecting
their generated tiles. The four status fields now share one row below the
legacy HUD at fixed x positions 4, 64, 106, and 154, with no overlap; each
published active snapshot redraws all four fields, including negative values.
The SPD field is ten six-pixel cells (`60` bytes), including one trailing
blank cell after every `SPD:<level>` label; this keeps the complete field
separated from `DIST` and prevents tile rows from straddling adjacent status
fields. The ladder has thirteen entries through `8.00X`. The FPS field update
also treats a falling VBLANK edge after the complete CPU tile write as a
diagnostic overrun, not a runtime failure, so a valid RIGHT/LEFT transition
at the 15-FPS entry cannot exit the guest after the field is already complete.

## Host and guest evidence

The independent control model covers all thirteen speed entries, all divisor
values, saturation/no-wrap, immutable snapshots, signed Q8.8 rounding, scale
clamps, W/S sign, O/P identity at 1.00X, status formatting, and the complete
projection boundary space:

```text
64 phases * 16 counts * 9 distances * 9 look levels * 9 radius levels
= 746,496 bounded projection cases
```

The repository-wide orbit/atlas/dirty-union/runtime suite completed **243
tests PASS**, including inherited public M98t/M98u/M98v/M98w/M98x coverage and
the M98z control tests. The inherited host transition and private-profile
tokens remain accepted: `HOST_PUBLIC_PROFILE_PASS`,
`PRIVATE_IDA_ASSET_VALIDATED`, `HOST_PRIVATE_IDA_PASS`,
`PRIVATE_IDA_ONE_BANK_PASS`, `PRIVATE_IDA_30_SCALE_PASS`,
`PRIVATE_IDA_32768_TRANSITIONS_PASS`, and `VAEG_PRIVATE_IDA_MULTI_PASS`.

The normal public guest is one deterministic binary, 52,656 bytes, and two
clean builds produced SHA-256
`e0f2111e4da5d0723633f6ac11658fad49f825c2bc6e6346578ac72ff67aa93f` after
the fixed-width SPD, extended speed ladder, and nonfatal completed-write
correction.
The legacy FPS/count HUD include remains byte-identical to its accepted
`fa5552dd236cc078e94d905e35698a9887269ede13aa4db86658988b16775b8e` identity;
the new status tiles are a separate generated include. Fixed-count QA builds
for 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 all assemble below 64 KiB. A private-profile build
also remains 49,856 bytes; private atlas identity, paths, hashes, and D88
details are intentionally excluded from this report.

The existing VAEG executable `build/macos-macports/sdl2/vaeg --selftest`
reported all tests passed. A fresh public count-four VA2-model candidate ran
one complete orbit and returned `M98X_VAEG_CAPTURE_PASS`; its generated D88,
trace, and framebuffer files remain ignored. VAEG timing is diagnostic only.

Repository checks passed:

```text
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py              0 finding(s)
python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py --expect utf8  0 violation(s)
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py --enforce     0 violation(s)
```

## QA limits and private-data proof

The public static/load and inherited full/dirty compositor matrices remain
unchanged; this milestone adds the control-state proof and bounded VA2 smoke
candidate without changing the atlas, SGP multiplier, cadence definitions, or
private profile bytes. Full physical hardware timing is not claimed.

Staged-change scans contain no ROM, viewer export, private manifest, palette,
private atlas, private binary/D88, screenshot, trace, private path, or private
hash. Generated guests, D88s, traces, and temporary host matrices remain
outside Git under ignored/generated or temporary paths. The final dirty state
matches the preflight baseline above.

The maintainer visual gate must still verify the public and private labels,
each new key direction and saturation bound, FPS/speed independence,
distance/look/radius behavior, pause/resume, count transitions, overlap,
phase wrap, both page parities, and ESC restoration. Until that explicit
approval is supplied, the milestone remains:

**G98z: human gate pending**

# M97 - SGP Technical Manual command completion report

Evaluated baseline: `79ce89af64958cd85cdffa030890fb24a2af8148`

Status: **candidate published; G97 pending**

## 1. Rejected QA milestone removal

The unmerged `topic/m97-deterministic-qa` branch contained only the rejected
M97/M98 QA foundation after the evaluated `main` baseline. The replacement
branch was recreated from the baseline. No QA source, generated D88, fake
BIOS, capture frontend, guest injection, task, or report from that branch is
part of this candidate.

Maintainer-local untracked references and private media were not removed or
modified.

## 3. Evidence corrections

Direct reading of the Technical Manual resolves two stale conclusions in the
existing reconstruction:

- the documented ROP order matches the current VAEG implementation;
- SCAN always searches for SET COLOR and documents first-pixel, found, and
  not-found results; it does not expose an undocumented equality selector.

LINE direction bits also use the same `VD` and `HD` positions as BITBLT and
PATBLT. Exact discrete-line tie breaking remains unresolved.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Descriptor and LINE decoding

`fetch_block()` now selects the descriptor profile from `pccore.model_va`.
The original VA profile masks width and height to 12 bits and framebuffer
pitch to a four-byte boundary, as documented by the Technical Manual block
diagrams. The existing VA2 profile retains its 14-bit width, 16-bit height,
two-byte pitch alignment, and observed R-TYPE compatibility adjustment.

LINE no longer has a separate swapped direction mapping. Its aliases now use
the documented common values `VD=0800h` and `HD=0400h`.

### 4.2 SCAN state machine

`SCAN RIGHT` and `SCAN LEFT` execute one pixel at a time through the existing
asynchronous SGP state machine. They reuse the saved destination runtime
fields, so `_SGP` and the binary `SGP` save-state section did not change.

Each step extracts the selected packed pixel and its corresponding packed SET
COLOR field. A match updates the documented output fields. A miss leaves the
input address, dot, and width unchanged. `SCAN LEFT` advances one pixel right
from the boundary color before recording the scanned region's left edge, as
shown by the manual diagram.

The implementation subtracts one internal scheduler quantum per scan pixel
only to make state-machine progress finite. This is not a recovered hardware
cycle count, and M97 makes no SGP timing or contention claim.

### 4.3 Focused regression coverage

The compiled selftest now verifies:

- original-VA and VA2 descriptor decoding separately;
- the common LINE direction masks;
- all sixteen documented Boolean ROP values;
- `TP=2` destination-zero masking;
- SCAN RIGHT first-pixel, later-pixel, miss, and packed-word-boundary cases;
- SCAN LEFT first-pixel, later-pixel, and miss cases, including returned left
  address/dot and width.

### 4.4 LINE visual gate program

At the maintainer's request, M97 adds the isolated
`demos/sgp-wireframe/sgp_wireframe.asm` visual test. It builds the DOS 8.3 name
`SGPWIRE.COM` and displays a regular tetrahedron, cube, regular dodecahedron,
and regular icosahedron in four viewports. The CPU performs signed fixed-point
rotation, perspective projection, and command-list generation. SGP CLS clears
the hidden half of a 640x800 Graphic 0 framebuffer and SGP LINE draws the grid
and all 78 solid edges before a vertical-blank DSA0 page exchange.

The first visual candidate incorrectly used `DX` to preserve an intermediate
rotation product even though the next one-operand 16-bit `IMUL` overwrote
`DX:AX`. This made valid edge tables appear as malformed solids. The corrected
projection stores each intermediate product before executing the next `IMUL`.
The former rectangular cuboid was also replaced with an actual cube.

Each solid has independent X/Y angular rates and a sinusoidal scale. Edge
brightness follows the projected endpoint depth, providing a simple depth cue
without claiming polygon filling. The documented SGP command set has no
general polygon or flood-fill command.

Graphics BIOS mode function 0 uses `BX=a000h` and `CL=4` for single-plane,
one-screen, 640x400, 4-bpp output. Function 1 defines Graphic 0 as 640x800;
its two 128,000-byte display halves occupy 256,000 bytes of the 256 KiB GVRAM.
The demo uses the existing hardware-safe startup contract: SET WORK begins
every list, `0500h`/`0502h` and the two DSA0 registers receive word writes,
and the GVRAM write-mode latch is restored before each kick. No generated COM
or disposable disk image is tracked.

### 4.5 16-bpp 320x200 page exchange correction

The direct-color teaching track under `demos/sgp-wireframe/65536/` uses the
74U11-derived `GRMODE=0xB462` / `GRRES=0x1313` profile with a 320x400 source
surface (`FBW=640`, `FBL=400`) and a 320x200 displayed window. Two contiguous
320x200 pages occupy byte offsets `0` and `0x1f400`; DSA0 is changed only
after SGP completion and the VBLANK wait. The earlier horizontal layout put
the pages in alternating halves of every row and required 200 row-sized CLS
commands. That was functionally correct but an unnecessarily large command
overhead. The vertical layout makes the hidden page linear, so one CLS of
`0xfa00` words clears it. All rendering remains in SGP and the command list
remains in main RAM. The projection keeps its Y coordinate in the 320x200
logical space; the earlier extra Y shift remains removed because it distorted
the aspect of the 200-line display raster.

### 4.6 Direct-color triangle scan exercise

The new `demos/sgp-scan/65536/sgptri.asm` is a separate direct-color teaching
exercise. It selects the 320x200 logical G0 view used by the existing 16-bpp
track, keeps two contiguous 320x200 pages in the 320x400 source surface, and
allows one through four independently rotating projected triangular plates to
be selected with the arrow keys. The CPU performs the fixed-point rotation,
projection, and shade choice. SGP performs the clear, background grid, SCAN
probes, and triangle outlines on the selected hidden 16-bpp frame.

Polygon filling is intentionally disabled again. The command set has no
documented polygon-fill opcode, and direct-color behavior of the Graphics BIOS
polygon/Paint services remains under evaluation. The demo does not claim that
an INT 87h/AH=15h Paint call emits `SCAN_RIGHT` or `SCAN_LEFT`; it emits both
SGP commands directly as harmless probes so VAEG tracing can verify that the
implemented SCAN handlers are reached.

The first implementation used signed 16-bit edge intersection and division in
the guest command builder. That path could stop before the SGP kick on malformed
projected edges. It was replaced with clipped min/max spans and bounded
addition/shift-only midpoint spans. Those fill paths are no longer called; the
current build emits only outline LINE records. This is emulator evidence only;
BIOS equivalence and real-hardware behavior remain unconfirmed.

## 5. Validation

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| UTF-8 / EOL / path-case validators | PASS, zero findings |
| Targeted clang-format 22 check for changed C files | PASS |
| Repository-wide clang-format check | PRE-EXISTING FAIL in unchanged `sdl2/np2.c` and `sdl2/scrnmng.c` |
| Unreferenced-source report | Completed; 40 pre-existing candidates, none added by M97 |
| Linux debug configure/build | PASS |
| `build/linux-debug/sdl2/vaeg --selftest` | PASS, including `SGP manual commands ok` |
| CTest | 83 PASS, 1 external-fixture SKIP, 0 FAIL |
| MinGW cross release build | PASS, PE32+ x86-64 GUI executable |
| `SGPWIRE.COM` deterministic NASM build | PASS, 5,663 bytes |
| VAEG wireframe smoke at two distinct frames | PASS, 640x400; four connected regular solids with changed pose/scale |

The task's initial `ctest --preset linux-debug` spelling was corrected because
the repository has configure/build presets but no CTest preset. The executed
command was `ctest --test-dir build/linux-debug --output-on-failure`.

## 7. Remaining unknowns

- the unnamed thirteenth command;
- the internal 58-byte SET WORK format;
- zero extents and other explicitly undefined descriptor cases;
- LINE tie-breaking details not stated by the recovered diagram;
- SCAN command timing, SGP/CPU bus arbitration, and status timing;
- reserved `TP=3` behavior;
- real-PC-88VA equivalence.

## 8. Human gate

G97 is pending. It is a VAEG visual-regression gate and does not require or
claim a real-hardware run. `SGPWIRE.COM` is now the LINE-specific visual part
of that gate rather than an optional unavailable fixture.

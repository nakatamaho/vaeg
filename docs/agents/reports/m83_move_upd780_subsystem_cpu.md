# M83: move the FDC uPD780 disassembler into `cpu/upd780/`

## Status

M83 has started from the approved G82 boundary. The evidence-backed source
move and reference fixups are complete. G83 has not been passed: the manual
FDD boot/access gate remains for maintainer verification.

Evaluated branch: `topic/m83-move-upd780-subsystem-cpu`

Evaluated source commit: [`4cf317a0bdf04b3da045f472f17f0dd8d08e3b2f`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/4cf317a0bdf04b3da045f472f17f0dd8d08e3b2f)

## Scope and boundary

M82 identified exactly two FDC-facing files for this move:

- `cpucva/upd780_disasm.cpp` → `cpu/upd780/upd780_disasm.cpp`
- `cpucva/upd780_disasm.h` → `cpu/upd780/upd780_disasm.h`

The first M83 implementation commit is the rename-only commit
[`b69716764d2e314db9600e5bc28553ac813a8a6e`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/b69716764d2e314db9600e5bc28553ac813a8a6e); Git records both files as 100% renames with no content change. The following reference-fixup commit [`96d39b7c4ce2e6aea279370db2b141d6f6cbfdf1`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/96d39b7c4ce2e6aea279370db2b141d6f6cbfdf1) updates the production/test CMake source paths, the subsystem and focused-test includes, the header guard, and current path documentation.

The shared `cpucva/z80_compat_*` backend and state codec remain in place. No
FDC protocol, scheduler, interrupt, WAIT, save-state payload, or uPD780
instruction behavior was changed. Historical M82 and Z80 migration documents
retain their original paths as historical evidence; current active documents
use `cpu/upd780/`.

The M83 start and ROADMAP correction are recorded in
[`383bfeb8cad8c33d66569bfa0409db8d4190dd92`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/383bfeb8cad8c33d66569bfa0409db8d4190dd92) and
[`4cf317a0bdf04b3da045f472f17f0dd8d08e3b2f`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/4cf317a0bdf04b3da045f472f17f0dd8d08e3b2f). The latter changes the M83 table status to the validator-compatible `G83 human; in progress` form.

## Validation

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/repo/check_case.py` | 0 findings |
| `tools/repo/check_encoding.py --expect utf8` | 0 violations |
| `tools/repo/check_eol.py --enforce` | 0 violations |
| `tools/qa/upd9002_rename.py` | PASS |
| `git diff --check` | PASS |
| `cmake --preset linux-ci-gcc` and `cmake --build --preset linux-ci-gcc -j4` | PASS |
| focused wrapper/disassembler/FDC/save-load tests | 6/6 passed |
| full `ctest --test-dir build/linux-ci-gcc --output-on-failure` | 83/83 passed; one external SST test skipped |

The focused six-test run covered `vaeg_idp_m69_status_composition`, both
uPD780 wrapper variants, `vaeg_upd780_disasm`, the state regression test, and
`vaeg_romless_tests`. The full CTest run passed the repository, wrapper, FDC,
SST, storage, and state suites; `vaeg_upd9002_ssts_ci_external` was skipped
because its external corpus is not present.

The pre-M83 CI baseline repair was [`0a2608351d4e301e9729d7d4ab25d662b98d8c74`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/0a2608351d4e301e9729d7d4ab25d662b98d8c74), which only updated stale M69 test API references and selected the current VA I/O mode in that test. Its final nine-job run was GitHub Actions run `31496082527`, with all jobs successful before M83 began.

The M83 path-move candidate also triggered GitHub Actions run `31498223361`; all nine jobs succeeded, including Windows MinGW compatibility. This hosted result validates the candidate build and tests but does not replace the required G83 human gate.

## Gate disposition

G83 is still pending. The maintainer must perform the standard human gate:
build from a clean checkout, boot in V3 mode, run the bundled VA demo, boot an
OS, and perform simple FDD operations. M83 must not be merged to `main` and
M84 must not start before that approval.

# M99z — final documentation and evidence assembly

Status: PASS for the documentation and machine-verifiable evidence assembly;
overall M99 remains BLOCKED by required real-GPU and performance evidence.

## Documentation completed

- [`native-crt-presentation.md`](../../architecture/native-crt-presentation.md)
  records framebuffer flow, backend ownership, lifecycle, capture isolation,
  and fallback transitions.
- [`native-crt-user-guide.md`](../../modernization/native-crt-user-guide.md)
  records build, enablement, package layout, runtime names, and capture use.
- [`native-crt-troubleshooting.md`](../../modernization/native-crt-troubleshooting.md)
  records diagnostic messages, loader-path checks, and recovery steps.
- [`m99g_dependency_audit.md`](m99g_dependency_audit.md) completes the
  dependency/provenance report required by the milestone sequence.
- `sdl2/README.md` now links the three user and architecture documents.

## QA and correction

The source-archive audit initially rejected the newly approved
`external/librashader` root. `tests/z80_compat/check_zex_archive.py` now
contains that explicit root in its allow-list. A source archive containing the
complete candidate tree then passed with 1,925 files; the existing ZEX and
private-media protections remain active.

The following repository checks passed after the documentation and allow-list
changes:

```text
python3 tools/qa/milestone_ids.py --selftest
python3 tools/qa/milestone_ids.py --discover
python3 tools/qa/milestone_ids.py --audit
python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py --expect utf8
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py --enforce
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py
git diff --check
```

The feature-on Linux build, focused librashader/ROM-less CTest (7/7), and
dummy-driver selftest were completed in M99y. The macOS feature-on build and
focused tests were also completed. No physical GPU result is claimed here.

## Gate disposition

G99-1, G99-2, and G99-6 remain PASS within their documented evidence scope.
G99-3, G99-4, G99-5, and G99-7 remain deferred because this environment does
not provide real Windows D3D11, Linux OpenGL, or macOS Metal presentation and
performance hardware. The final goal report records the hosted CI result and
the smallest remaining action.

# M97 P4 transient-overfill follow-up

## Scope and baseline

The baseline was commit `ed70a11` (`M97a: render GLASS faces as convex
polygons`).  The final VAEG frame already had zero face underfill/overfill and
no internal holes.  The remaining report from real hardware was a temporary
roughly four-logical-pixel protrusion while a span was being written.

The VAEG run does not model a real-PC-88VA display observer at each CPU/SGP
write.  Consequently, the exact hardware transient is not claimed as
reproduced here.

## Before/after ownership

Before this change, the SGP range was calculated using equivalent outward
pixel-coordinate rounding, while the endpoint pass replayed **every** word in
the exact span.  For a representative span `[103,246]`, the intended SGP range
was words `26..60`; the endpoint pass subsequently walked words `25..61`.
The endpoint RMW preserved the final pixels, but complete interior words had
two owners and a second write stage.

The corrected partition is explicit and disjoint:

```text
logical span [103,246]
  left partial RMW: word 25
  SGP full words:   words 26..60
  right partial RMW: word 61
```

Same-word spans use one masked RMW and no SGP full-word command.  A partial
endpoint is never included in the SGP full-word set.  Complete interior words
are no longer replayed by the endpoint pass.

## Implementation

`glass_p4_sgp_emit_span` now derives `first_word`, `last_word`,
`full_first`, `full_last`, and `full_count` directly from the inclusive logical
span.  The endpoint record stores that partition and the face identifier.
`glass_p4_sgp_apply_endpoint_spans` applies only partial endpoint words and
skips the SGP-owned interior range.  The `GLASS_P4_SGP_AUDIT=1` build exports
the records to a gated GVRAM diagnostic area; the production build leaves this
disabled.

## Temporal QA

The independent checker is
`demos/va/glass-orbit/tools/verify-p4-temporal.py`.  It reconstructs each
operation in the order `left-RMW`, `SGP-full`, `right-RMW`, checks endpoint and
interior disjointness, and checks that every intermediate face-color set is a
subset of the exact logical span.  It also runs endpoint-residue and sloped
convex-polygon matrices.

VAEG audit result:

```text
records: 192
max_transient_overfill: 0
max_transient_underfill: 170 (allowed during progressive fill)
monotonic_fill: true
alignment_matrix: PASS (40 cases)
slope_matrix: PASS
overall temporal partition: PASS
```

The audit is a write-partition witness, not a silicon timing trace.  The audit
area is used only in the gated diagnostic payload and is masked by the normal
visual checker.

Standard (audit-disabled) VAEG capture remains:

```text
final face underfill: 0
final face overfill: 0
internal holes: 0
triangle-union mismatch: 0
visual verifier: PASS
```

Focused source, payload, and unit checks pass:

```text
check-p4-no-repair.py: PASS
check-p4-convex.py (sgp): PASS
test_verify_p4_temporal.py: PASS
```

## Hardware status

No new real-hardware observation was performed in this follow-up.  Existing
human-gate observations remain unchanged:

```text
PC-88VA:
  graphics: PASS
  transient overfill: UNVERIFIED
  ESC return: PASS
  keyboard after return: UNRESOLVED

PC-88VA2:
  graphics: PASS
  transient overfill: UNVERIFIED
  ESC return: PASS
  keyboard after return: PASS
```

This change does not claim SCAN_LEFT/SCAN_RIGHT hardware conformance.

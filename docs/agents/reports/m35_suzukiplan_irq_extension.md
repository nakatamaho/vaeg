# M35 suzukiplan Z80 IRQ extension evidence

## Status and entry state

The focused extension and its required tests are complete. The maintainer
approved the reproducible downstream patch provenance and documented callback
test matrix, and G35 passed on 2026-07-15. M36 is not authorized until the
maintainer explicitly instructs it.

The vaeg M35 branch started as
`topic/m35-z80-upstream-extension` at
`bc0b7b631aee6ace5d1c35944e40d7ba098be745`. Tracked files were clean. The
following twelve untracked paths predated M35 and were left untouched:

```text
PC-Engine 1.05(86U13).d88
beep-bank.log
beep-head.log
beep-iptrace.log
beep-m17.log
beep-no-event.log
beep-no-pcm.log
beep-sound-off.log
beep.log
docs/modernization/PCEPAT.DOC
docs/tekumani/
his.txt
```

The upstream worktree was clean at release `1.10.0`, commit
`e3926769a790fab0af1c34a5540e317f8d4f0ddc`, repository
`https://github.com/suzukiplan/z80`. No core was copied into vaeg.

## Verified source result

The local upstream result is commit
`b4a0a5a238fecc280781e6fe5719faf0eafcd667`, tree
`8a606eb39332a6e79b69bb62d9dedca042b923dc`. It changes exactly four upstream
files:

```text
README.md
test/Makefile
test/test-interrupt-extension.cpp
z80.hpp
```

At that result:

- `z80.hpp:259-303` carries the normal and `Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL` acknowledge
  callback forms and the separate external IRQ-line state.
- `z80.hpp:5981-6036` accepts either the legacy one-shot request or the level
  line, invokes the callback once after EI inhibition and IFF acceptance,
  preserves the external line, injects the IM0 byte through `opSet1`, ignores
  it for IM1 dispatch, and uses it for IM2.
- `z80.hpp:6022-6025` makes the IM2 low-byte/high-byte vector reads explicit;
  it no longer depends on C++11 function-argument evaluation order.
- `z80.hpp:6161-6173` initializes the new callback and line state.
- `z80.hpp:6386-6410` exposes callback setup/reset and inspectable/restorable
  `setIRQLine` and `isIRQLineAsserted` APIs.
- Existing users that only call `generateIRQ` retain its one-shot behavior;
  `test/test-interrupt-extension.cpp` includes an acceptance and cancellation
  regression for that path.

The public register state remains sufficient for architectural state, HALT,
and `execEI` import/export. The only additional restorable state is the
external level-sensitive IRQ line, now available through its setter/getter.
M35 found no evidence requiring a broader state API.

## Corrected source contradiction

Before this milestone, `docs/agents/DECISIONS/ADR-0011-z80-migration.md:35`
claimed `Copyright (c) 2021-2023 Yoji Suzuki`. At the exact selected base,
`LICENSE.txt:3` and `z80.hpp:6` both state `Copyright (c) 2019 Yoji Suzuki`.
ADR-0011 now records the source-backed year. This is a documentation
correction; the MIT-license decision and verified license hash are unchanged.

The base and result use the same `LICENSE.txt` Git blob,
`a4cbbf62b0edaf761ef48556c7a2e50bb3b4817f`, and the same SHA-256,
`ca7261ecf96ab7fea40c4c66aeb644710d210bd71418d285a9dd0098a7bddff1`.
The extension does not modify the license file or its MIT notice.

## Focused coverage

The new test source runs the same 21 cases in normal `std::function` and
`Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL` builds. It verifies:

- inspect and restore of the external IRQ level;
- DI blocking, EI delay, and a callback byte changed by the inhibited
  instruction before acceptance;
- deassertion before acceptance and persistence across a later EI;
- exact-once acknowledge at acceptance, HALT wake, and NMI non-acknowledge;
- IM0 raw `RST 08h`, `NOP`, `LD A,A` (`0x7f`), and `CALL` without fetching or
  advancing PC for the supplied first byte;
- CB, ED, DD, FD, DDCB, and FDCB continuation bytes fetched from current PC;
- IM1 acknowledge with ignored byte and IM2 callback/vector read order; and
- unchanged legacy one-shot acceptance and cancellation when the new APIs are
  not used.

## Commands and results

All upstream commands ran in a clean checkout or worktree derived from the
exact base. The vaeg repository checks ran against the staged evidence change.

| Command | Result |
|---|---|
| `make -C test` before modification | PASS; complete pre-change upstream suite |
| `make test-interrupt-extension test-interrupt-extension-no-functional` in `test/` | PASS; 21/21 normal and 21/21 `Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL` |
| `make` in `test/` | PASS; every existing target plus both new focused targets |
| `make cpm` in `test-ex/` | PASS; CP/M exerciser built with Clang and `Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL` |
| `./cpm -e -n zexdoc.cim` | PASS; every group `OK`, exit 0, 46,748,863,012 emulated clocks |
| `./cpm -e -n zexall.cim` | PASS; every group `OK`, exit 0, 46,748,863,012 emulated clocks |
| `git diff --check` | PASS; no whitespace errors |
| `git clang-format --diff e3926769a790fab0af1c34a5540e317f8d4f0ddc` | PASS; no changed-range formatting diff |
| `git am /home/maho/vaeg/docs/agents/reports/m35_suzukiplan_irq_extension.patch` from the exact base | PASS; resulting tree `8a606eb39332a6e79b69bb62d9dedca042b923dc` exactly matches the tested result |
| `python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py` in vaeg | PASS; exit 0 |
| `python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py` in vaeg | PASS; exit 0 |
| `python3 tools/repo/check_case.py` in vaeg | PASS; exit 0, 0 findings |
| `python3 tools/repo/find_unreferenced.py` in vaeg | PASS; exit 0, 69 unreferenced paths reported and no M35 path |
| `git diff --cached --check` in vaeg | PASS; the generated patch is treated as patch data by its exact-path `-diff` attribute |

### Approved callback test matrix and baseline limitation

After the required tests passed, the following additional diagnostic was run
on the M35 result:

```sh
make CFLAGS='-I../ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wfloat-equal -Wshadow -Wunused-variable -Wsign-conversion -Wclass-varargs -Wtype-limits -Wsequence-point -Wunsequenced -Werror -DZ80_NO_FUNCTIONAL'
```

It exits 2 at the first target. `test/test-checkreg-on-callback.cpp:88` passes
the capturing lambda `[=, &expectIndex]` to the function-pointer `Z80`
constructor selected by `Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL`; Clang correctly reports no
conversion. The same target and flags were then run from a separate clean
checkout at exact base `e3926769a790fab0af1c34a5540e317f8d4f0ddc`:

```sh
make test-checkreg-on-callback CFLAGS='-I../ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wfloat-equal -Wshadow -Wunused-variable -Wsign-conversion -Wclass-varargs -Wtype-limits -Wsequence-point -Wunsequenced -Werror -DZ80_NO_FUNCTIONAL'
```

It fails identically at `test/test-checkreg-on-callback.cpp:88`, before any
M35 code exists. Other existing tests also contain capturing callback lambdas,
so porting the entire legacy harness set is a separate, non-minimal test rewrite.

The maintainer accepted the verified green matrix: complete existing `test/`
suite in its supported default configuration; focused M35 tests in both
configurations; and ZEXDOC/ZEXALL in the supported harness configuration.
Legacy tests that already fail to compile with `Z80_NO_FUNCTIONAL` at the
approved base do not need an M35 rewrite because the baseline limitation is
reproduced and documented above.

The focused build used the upstream warning policy with Clang 21.1.8,
C++11, `-Wall`, the upstream additional warnings, and `-Werror`. ZEX used the
upstream C++17 CP/M harness. These are public upstream test inputs; no private
ROM or disk-image data was used.

M35 changes only vaeg documentation, provenance, and the generated patch; it
does not change a vaeg build target. The task therefore requires no vaeg CMake
build or CTest run, and none is claimed as M35 evidence.

## Approved downstream patch provenance

The maintainer approved the directly applicable
[format patch](m35_suzukiplan_irq_extension.patch):

| Item | Value |
|---|---|
| Base commit | `e3926769a790fab0af1c34a5540e317f8d4f0ddc` |
| Tested local result | `b4a0a5a238fecc280781e6fe5719faf0eafcd667` |
| Result tree | `8a606eb39332a6e79b69bb62d9dedca042b923dc` |
| Patch SHA-256 | `d8624085139ef4e7b400b918b2b498e79bea1af4a1942e4ac935545846e746a4` |
| License | Unchanged MIT, Copyright (c) 2019 Yoji Suzuki |
| Clean `git am` reproduction | Passed |
| MIT license verification | Passed |
| Public upstream/fork commit | Not required for G35 |

The `.patch` file is generated third-party commit evidence and intentionally
retains standard `git format-patch` metadata rather than a vaeg BSD header.
The vaeg-authored evidence document carries the repository BSD-2-Clause
header. Its exact path is marked `-diff` in `.gitattributes` so an outer vaeg
diff does not reinterpret whitespace-significant upstream context as vaeg
whitespace errors; the artifact remains LF text and is hash-verified above.

## Facts, hypotheses, and recommendation

Verified facts:

- The focused extension satisfies the required IRQ line, acknowledge timing,
  IM0/IM1/IM2, state-access, and dual-callback-build contracts in its tests.
- The complete existing upstream suite is green in its supported default
  callback configuration, and ZEXDOC/ZEXALL are green in their supported
  harness configuration.
- The MIT license is unchanged.
- The format patch applies directly to the exact approved base and recreates
  the tested tree.
- vaeg contains only evidence, not a vendored or integrated core, and no
  guest-visible behavior was changed.

Hypotheses or externally unresolved items:

- Upstream acceptance is unknown because no issue or pull request could be
  published, but it is not a G35 provenance requirement.

**G35 PASSED; STOP BEFORE M36.** The approved base and downstream patch
reproduce the tested result tree, license verification passes, and the accepted
test matrix is green. M36 must not begin until the maintainer explicitly
instructs it.

## Unresolved risks

- Upstream acceptance is still unknown; downstream maintenance may remain
  necessary, although the approved patch is reproducible and sufficient for
  vaeg provenance.
- The focused patch has been exercised on this Linux/Clang host, not on every
  future vaeg build host. M36 must reproduce tree
  `8a606eb39332a6e79b69bb62d9dedca042b923dc` before vendoring and record the
  approved base SHA, patch SHA-256, and resulting tree hash in the vendored
  provenance file.
- This milestone intentionally does not integrate the core with vaeg, so
  guest-system interrupt behavior remains for the later differential and
  integration gates.

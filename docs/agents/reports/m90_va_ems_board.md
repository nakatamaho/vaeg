# M90: VA EMS board

## Status

M90 is implementation-complete at candidate
[`081a2bb`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/081a2bbffaa14e4bdcc7a9d5627f147bd00f9970)
on `main`. G90 remains a human gate.

The predecessor is the G89-integrated `main` commit
[`c65853c`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/c65853cfd2f5ff5318c1a11fec384961037bfdbb).

## Delivered behavior

- `Device / EMS Board...` appears immediately below I/O Bank Memory.
- EMS is disabled by `ExMemory=0`; enabled capacities are 1 through 13MB in
  1MB units, with a clean-configuration default of 1MB.
- Applying a changed capacity persists it and resets the guest. Cancel and an
  unchanged value do not reset the guest.
- The retained `08E1H`, `08E3H`, `08E5H`, `08E7H`, and `08E9H` interface is
  attached to both VA and compatibility I/O dispatch.
- The four 16KB windows remain at `C0000H`, `C4000H`, `C8000H`, and `CC000H`;
  target zero restores ordinary memory mapping. Native VA memory accesses now
  reach the selected EMS pages as well as compatibility-mode accesses.
- EMS and I/O Bank Memory remain independent configuration mechanisms.
- The supplemental-disk builder retains EMMVA15A and RDEMS152 archives,
  installs their three redistributable SYS files, builds the PC-88VA
  `SQEMM98.SYS` manager with pinned Open Watcom, and installs the manuals and
  licenses.
- The generated root `CONFIG.SYS` loads `EMMVA01.SYS`, `SQEMM98.SYS`,
  `EMMVA02.SYS`, and `RDEMS.SYS -P40 -A` in that order. The supplemental
  media retains the PC-Engine 1.1 IPL and four fixed system files and boots
  that complete stack directly.
- SQEMM98 initialization and diagnostic messages use PC-Engine Text BIOS
  `INT 83H/AH=02H`. The generated binary contains no IBM video BIOS `INT 10H`
  and no DOS `INT 21H/AH=09H` string-output path. It preserves the PC-Engine
  loader's caller state and uses validated built-in defaults rather than
  interpreting the incompatible request-header command-tail field.

The evaluated macOS executable has SHA-256

The Windows MSYS2 release artifact from hosted run `31678186077` has SHA-256
`d7ce39475aaf00719b2a7b59298a46d69c76e690024ef0f7df4e010e6cfa755f`.

The first hosted run after the bootable-media correction,
[31674777821](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/actions/runs/31674777821),
exposed a test-fixture defect: the state-save selftest destroyed the global
I/O tables, then the EMS selftest called `emsio_bind()` on their stale base
pointers. Linux GCC/Clang segfaulted and ASan identified a heap-use-after-free
in `getextiofunc`; Windows compatibility failed on the same unit-test step.
The final candidate builds isolated I/O tables inside the EMS test and
destroys them on cleanup. The three affected local CTests, the complete 81-test
suite, a macOS ASan/UBSan selftest, and all nine jobs in the final hosted run
passed after that correction.

A later maintainer-side 13MB run reported the expected 832-page capacity but
then failed SQEMM98's memory test. The reported executable identity did not
match any retained M90 hosted Windows artifact examined. The same supplemental
D88 and `ExMemory=13` configuration pass with candidate `081a2bb` on both VA1
and VA2, including a usable RDEMS `C:` drive. A controlled negative build that
removed the native VA page-frame correction from `a4b6170` failed the ROM-less
selftest with `native VA page-frame access did not map`. The observed report is
therefore consistent with an executable that omits that correction; the exact
provenance of the maintainer-side binary remains unresolved, and no new D88 or
SQEMM98 defect was demonstrated.

The generated supplemental media and all raw validation logs remain outside
Git. The maintainer-supplied source media was used only through a disposable
copy; its private checksum is not recorded here. The canonical generated
output has SHA-256
`477d7cd94ccc2a70ffac9e47d8c9cb3f59ba8d1de8183c53239e92cbc96e0cc9`.

The headless boot used a disposable copy of that generated disk. PC-Engine
displayed EMMVA01, SQEMM98, EMMVA02, and RDEMS messages; SQEMM98 reported a
successful full-page memory test and 1.0MB capacity. RDEMS registered its
640KB RAM disk as `C:` because `B:` remains the second floppy. Guest commands
listed `C:`, copied root `CONFIG.SYS` to `C:\M90TEST.TXT`, listed the new
114-byte file, and read all four driver lines back. The disposable D88 was
unchanged after the run.

The 13MB follow-up used two additional disposable copies, one each for VA1 and
VA2. Both copies retained the canonical D88 identity after execution. Each
guest reached `Ready`; `dir c:` then reported 647,168 bytes available, proving
that RDEMS remained registered after SQEMM98's complete 832-page memory test.

## G90 human gate

From a clean checkout and clean configuration:

1. Complete the standard V3-mode, bundled-demo, OS-boot, and simple-operation
   gate.
2. Confirm EMS Board appears below I/O Bank Memory, defaults to 1MB, accepts
   1 through 13MB, persists, and resets only when applying a change.
3. Boot the generated supplemental disk and verify SQEMM98's PC-Engine BIOS
   messages, configured capacity, and distinct data in multiple 16KB pages.
4. Verify `RDEMS.SYS` loads after SQEMM98 and supports RAM-disk read/write.
5. Enable I/O Bank Memory concurrently and verify both mechanisms.
6. Disable EMS Board and verify normal V3/OS operation.

G90 passes only when the maintainer explicitly reports that this gate passed.

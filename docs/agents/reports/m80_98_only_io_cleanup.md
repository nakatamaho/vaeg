# M80: 98-only I/O cleanup report

## Status

M80 is active on `topic/m80-98-only-io-cleanup`. The implementation
checkpoint is
[`a1291121604af6ca27c690214bed337704976fbe`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/a1291121604af6ca27c690214bed337704976fbe).
G80 remains pending. This report does not declare the human gate passed and
M80 has not been merged to `main`.

The candidate starts from M79/`main` at
[`1e19c4c539fd99dcc7dcd4a92770a51aef93aad1`](https://github.com/nakatamaho/vaeg/commit/1e19c4c539fd99dcc7dcd4a92770a51aef93aad1).

## Evidence boundary

The PC-98 reference material in `docs/98io` was decoded from its original
CP932 text for this audit. The PC-88VA technical material in `docs/tekumani`
was decoded from Shift-JIS for this audit. These source documents were used
read-only and were not copied into the candidate branch.

The active dispatcher has two maps. `iomode_va` selects the VA map; the
common map remains relevant when the compatibility path selects it. Therefore
a device being documented as a PC-98 device is not, by itself, proof that its
common-map implementation is unreachable from the VA product.

## Candidate decisions

| Candidate | Decision | Evidence and reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `epsonio` | Already absent | M72 already removed `io/epsonio.c/.h`; no active source or CMake entry remains. |
| `nmiio` | Removed | `docs/98io/io_nmi.txt` describes PC-9800/PC-H98 NMI flip-flop ports 0050h/0052h. The active implementation only stored `nmiio.enable`; no active source read that field. Its only remaining references were the lifecycle table, CMake, and its own state-save entry. |
| `emsio` | Retained | `docs/98io/io_mem.txt` identifies the EMS board targets, but the implementation changes active CPU EMS frame mappings through `CPU_SETEMM`. The common-map/V1-V2 compatibility dependency is not disproven. |
| `printif` | Retained | The 98 reference documents a common 0040h printer interface. The VA manual documents the VA printer at 0010h/0040h, while the source has a separate VA `sysportva` map and a common `printif` map. Removing the common handler without a V1/V2 mode proof would be speculative. |
| `necio` | Retained | The implementation changes `CPU_ITFBANK`, and the active BIOS memory path consumes that bank for the F8000h-FFFFFh range. It cannot be removed as an inert registration. |
| `artic` | Retained | The callback is called from the active `pccore_exec` frame loop, and the dispatcher has an explicit ARTIC 005Ch-005Fh word-read path. `docs/98io/io_tstmp.txt` also documents this counter interface. |
| `fdd320` | Deferred | The task explicitly defers this candidate. `docs/98io/io_2d.txt` documents 320KB/2D FDD hardware, and the VA material documents 5-inch 2D support, so a separate PC-88-side audit is required. |

## State-save compatibility

The removed `NMIIO` entry was a raw four-byte binary section. The current
state loader already treats an unknown section as a warning and continues.
For an explicit compatibility check, a state produced by the candidate
selftest was copied to a disposable test artifact and a four-byte `NMIIO`
section was inserted immediately before `NP2SYSPORT`. The candidate loader
accepted that state with a warning rather than `STATFLAG_FAILURE`; the
remaining selftest completed successfully. New states no longer emit
`NMIIO`.

No ARTIC, EMSIO, or NECIO state section was removed.

```

Manual VA device validation is still required at G80. In particular, the
candidate has not yet received the required clean-checkout V3 boot, bundled
VA demo, OS/device operation, and maintainer human review.

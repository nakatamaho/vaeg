# M99z7 — Windows renderer selection and black fallback

Status: candidate; physical Windows CRT acceptance remains OPEN.
Starting commit: `77bca4d6f9ec479245358997c39b90dcb703025e`.
Branch: `topic/m99-native-crt-rebuild`; main checkout changes are untouched.

## Findings and changes

- Remove UI size from the menu, retaining automatic Windows DPI and the
  existing config override. Replace the ambiguous enable toggle with
  `CRT shader > SDL / librashader`. Explicit SDL selection destroys the
  native presenter and recreates SDL resources; selecting librashader again
  retries initialization. Filter-failure fallback remains native pass-through.
- The pass-through strip's winding is counterclockwise in render-target space.
  D3D11 default raster state culls back faces with clockwise fronts. Previously
  binding a null rasterizer could therefore remove the entire guest quad.
  Bind an explicit no-cull state, created once and released with the device.
  The production shader and rasterizer descriptor are shared with a Windows
  WARP readback regression test; it compares old default state with no-cull
  using the same 16x16 target, source texture and shaders.
- PE inspection of the pinned official DLL found external imports
  `D3DX9_43.dll`, `MSVCP140.dll`, `VCRUNTIME140.dll`, and
  `VCRUNTIME140_1.dll`. The former package validation established hashes
  and payload shape, not target-machine dependency availability. Missing
  dependencies are a supported failure case, not established as the exact
  cause on the maintainer's machine without its log.
- Wrap (do not modify) the audited upstream loader to report Win32 load errors,
  unavailable dependencies, required symbols, API/ABI and loaded DLL path.
  Preserve actual preset/filter errors through presenter and frontend.
  Upstream no-op stubs are not sufficient proof that required symbols exist.
- The package guide links official Microsoft DirectX June 2010 and VC++ x64
  installers. No installer is run automatically and no Microsoft DLL is
  redistributed without a separate license review.

## Validation

Commands (repository root):

```sh
CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --build --preset mingw-cross -j4
CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --build build/macos-ci -j4
CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --build build/macos-macports -j4
ctest --test-dir build/macos-ci --output-on-failure -R '^(vaeg_librashader_|vaeg_romless_tests$|vaeg_sdl_startup_viewport$)'
ctest --test-dir build/macos-macports --output-on-failure -R '^(vaeg_librashader_|vaeg_romless_tests$|vaeg_sdl_startup_viewport$)'
CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --build build/m99-gui-debug --target vaeg_librashader_controller_test vaeg_librashader_d3d11_lifecycle_test vaeg_librashader_presenter_state_test vaeg_librashader_pass_through_test vaeg_librashader_fallback_test -j4
ctest --test-dir build/m99-gui-debug --output-on-failure -R '^vaeg_librashader_'
python3 tools/repo/check_encoding.py --expect utf8
python3 tools/repo/check_eol.py --enforce
python3 tools/repo/check_case.py
git diff --check
```

MinGW build PASS; feature-on/off macOS builds PASS; focused suites 10/10 each;
assertion-enabled Debug suite 8/8. Added checks prove detailed errors survive
successful fallback rendering and clear on recovery. Existing Apple linker
warnings and unused Release assert-fixture warnings remain unrelated.

The Windows raster test cross-compiles with:

```sh
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -std=c++17 -Isdl2 tests/frontend/librashader/test_d3d11_raster.cpp -o build/mingw-cross/vaeg-d3d11-raster-test.exe -ld3d11 -ld3dcompiler -static-libgcc -static-libstdc++
```

Runtime command on Windows:
`ctest --test-dir <windows-build> -R vaeg_librashader_d3d11_raster -V`.
Expected white-pixel counts: default=0, explicit-no-cull=256/256.
At preparation time no Windows/Wine execution environment is available locally;
compilation is not a PASS claim for the readback assertions. Hosted results
must be recorded separately. WARP is software rasterization, not GPU performance
or librashader filter-chain acceptance.

## Dependency and evidence boundaries

librashader remains v0.12.0 / commit
`87e8a97b50516d997defeaa168173dcd185d4022`, C API 5 / ABI 2.
The official x64 DLL remains SHA-256
`1890f647c7fbe52d4cc591526db24367caca284996855c4565c6003c7e46f8cc`.
No vendor shader or runtime changes; existing MPL-2.0 / MIT / Unlicense
decisions remain in force. No emulator-core/raw-capture changes.

[D3D11 rasterizer defaults](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/d3d11/ns-d3d11-d3d11_rasterizer_desc)
document back-face culling and clockwise fronts.
[DirectX runtime](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8109)
supplies the legacy D3DX libraries; the
[VC++ runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist)
supplies the MSVC runtime imports.

Remaining evidence: the maintainer's loader log, actual CRT output, SDL/native
switching and DPI input behavior on the affected Windows machine. G99-3 and
performance gates remain open. No measured physical GPU performance is claimed.

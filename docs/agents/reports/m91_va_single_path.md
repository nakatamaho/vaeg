# M91: native V3 VA single-path report

## Status

M91 implementation is complete on `topic/m91-va-single-path` at
`b20da74a4fab80877b7449f82e766ade6782615a`. Automated validation passes.
G91 remains pending and no merge to `main` is claimed.

## Evidence boundary

The maintainer-provided `docs/tekumani` and `docs/98io` trees are local,
read-only reference material and are not copied into this branch. Tekumani is
the authority for built-in PC-88VA functions. The PC-98 material is used only
to identify inherited implementations and same-number semantic collisions.
A shared port number is not evidence that two devices have the same behavior.

## Implemented single path

| Area | M91 result |
| --- | --- |
| I/O dispatch | `io/iocore.c` now owns one 16-bit VA map. The `iomode_va` selector and separate common/VA attach APIs are gone. Word I/O dispatches the low byte and then the adjacent high byte, including a `00FFH` to `0100H` page crossing. |
| Mixed port bindings | Removed inherited PC-98 aliases from DMA, FDC, serial, PIC, PIT, calendar/system-port, SASI, SCSI, BMS, EMS, NP2SYSP, and sound-extension registration. VA and separately owned expansion routes remain. |
| Memory | Public CPU and DMA access always enters `memoryva`. The `memmode_va` selector is gone. Explicit raw main-RAM helpers are used only by VA map entries. Direct instruction-memory bypass thresholds are disabled so mapped TVRAM and BMS windows cannot be skipped. |
| Test isolation | CPU-only semantic tests may explicitly request a flat 20-bit fixture through a test-build-only seam. Production builds contain no alternate machine-mode selector. The M68 mapped-memory test continues to exercise the VA decoder. |
| CGROM | The V3 `014CH`-`014FH` route in `io/cgromva.c` is canonical. The inherited PC-98 CGROM window was removed. |
| Initialization | Reset and bind tables now initialize only the VA/shared active device set. Inactive inherited sources remain outside CMake unless deletion was explicitly approved. |
| State save | Retired PC-98 ARTIC and NECIO sections and callbacks are no longer registered. |

## Tekumani and PC-98 comparison

- Tekumani assigns V3 Kanji CG access to `014CH`-`014FH`: a hardware
  character code, raster/left-right selection, and font read or user-defined
  glyph write access. Comments in `io/cgromva.c` now describe those fields and
  distinguish documented behavior from the existing font-image layout.
- Tekumani assigns `0160H`-`016FH` to the VA DMA controller. Comments identify
  the implemented registers, unimplemented device-control pair, mode bits,
  and the current base/current register limitation.
- Tekumani specifies a 600 ms FDD motor wait. The existing 505 ms emulator
  value is retained and explicitly labelled as an approximation; M91 does not
  change timing.
- Tekumani documents keyboard command classes at `0197H`. The implementation
  comment records both the documented class bits and the VA ROM command values
  actually accepted by the model.
- `docs/98io/io_tstmp.txt` identifies the inherited ARTIC timestamp/wait
  device at `005CH`, `005EH`, and `005FH`. Tekumani assigns those addresses to
  VA1/V2 GVRAM selection/status with different semantics. M91 therefore
  removes ARTIC without inventing the deferred VA1/V2 behavior.

## Deletion and retention boundary

The only physically deleted sources are the four files explicitly approved by
the maintainer:

- `io/artic.c`
- `io/artic.h`
- `io/cgrom.c`
- `io/cgrom.h`

The following inactive PC-98 closure is retained in the source tree but is no
longer part of the portable CMake build: `cpu/upd9002/egcmem.c`,
`io/cpuio.c`, `io/dipsw.c`, `io/egc.c`, `io/fdd320.c`, `io/necio.c`,
`io/np2vasup.c`, `io/printif.c`, and `vram/vram.c`. Their physical deletion
requires separate maintainer approval.

## Comment audit

Comments changed by M91 are English and describe native VA behavior rather
than translating inherited PC-98 labels. They explicitly mark documented
semantics, observed ROM behavior, emulator approximations, and unimplemented
features. A Japanese-character census over every modified C, C++, header, and
macro source returned no matches. Repository encoding, EOL, and case checks
also report zero violations. Unrelated untouched sources are outside this
comment-only census.

| M61, M62, M65c, M68 focused CPU tests | PASS |
| `ctest --test-dir build/m91-tests --output-on-failure` | PASS, 0 failures among 83 registered tests; 1 external SST corpus test explicitly skipped because no corpus was supplied |
| `CCACHE_DISABLE=1 cmake --preset mingw-cross` and `cmake --build --preset mingw-cross -j4` | PASS |

The macOS executable SHA-256 is
`fadfa1f4b776d86e607eef5824e1fd46227ad1efdb7ae8550d0601b3f8cfdbe9`.
The MinGW executable SHA-256 is
`0d1e4038593c5b72ceb7a8a403ec5f3763544b41b710a09bd13e26417b184cd3`.
Warnings printed by these builds are pre-existing warning classes; no M91
compile or link failure remains.

## Gate

G91 remains a human gate. From a clean checkout of the pushed candidate, the
maintainer must still verify native V3 boot, the bundled VA demo, an OS boot,
and simple FDD/storage, keyboard, display, sound, and state-save operations.
No result for those manual operations is claimed here. M92 must not begin and
M91 must not merge to `main` until the maintainer states that G91 passed.

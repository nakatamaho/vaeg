# ADR-0008: SDL2 Keyboard Mapping Policy

Date: 2026-07-08

Status: Accepted

## Context

G11 exposed that the old SDL2 keyboard table was a partial 101-key map:
common alphanumeric keys worked, but PC-88VA/PC-8801-specific keys such
as Kana, Henkan, NFER/Kettei, RO/underscore, Zenkaku, and keypad Return
were incomplete or unavailable on US host keyboards.

M14 needs a complete, documented keyboard inventory without changing the
guest keyboard protocol or writing directly into guest text buffers.

## Decision

- Use SDL scancodes for guest input mapping. Do not use SDL key symbols
  as guest keys.
- Store custom host bindings by SDL scancode name, not numeric scancode
  values. GUI-edited bindings are persisted in `keyboard.map` beside
  `np2.cfg`, with `keyboard_custom_map=file:keyboard.map` as the INI
  pointer, so long binding tables do not exceed the legacy INI reader's
  practical line length.
- Use QUASI88 only as semantic naming reference for PC-8801-style key
  roles. Do not copy QUASI88 numeric `KEY88_*` values.
- Prove VA guest key codes from this repository, primarily
  `keystat.h`, `win9x/winkbd.cpp`, and `io/serial.c`.
- Route physical and synthetic input through `sdl2/kbdinject.c`, which
  wraps the existing `keystat_senddata()` and `keystat_forcerelease()`
  make/break path.
- Provide JIS, US, and Custom host layouts. JIS is the fidelity preset;
  US is a usability fallback for common modern keyboards.
- Leave the VA PC key default unassigned: the guest code is proven, but
  SDL has no standard modern physical scancode for that role.
- Roman-Kana parses A-Z and apostrophe host scancodes into internal kana
  tokens and then emits guest key sequences. It ignores SDL_TEXTINPUT for
  guest input so host IME state and UTF-8 composition cannot leak into the
  guest. It never injects Unicode, CP932, BIOS/DOS buffers, RAM, or VRAM.
  The menu selects JIS-Kana or Roman-Kana as the kana input method only.
  Guest kana mode is entered and left by the assigned KANA key: one press
  locks KANA, the next press unlocks it. Roman-Kana consumes A-Z
  scancodes only while that KANA lock mirror is active.

## Consequences

- ImGui input capture remains the boundary: captured key or text events
  never reach the guest, including Roman-Kana helper output.
- Missing host bindings are visible in `docs/modernization/keyboard-mapping.md`
  and in the ImGui binding table.
- The loader accepts the initial inline M14 custom-map format for
  migration, but new saves use the sidecar form.
- Manual G14 testing must confirm physical JIS behavior, US fallback
  usability, Kana lock behavior, Roman-Kana output, and rebinding.

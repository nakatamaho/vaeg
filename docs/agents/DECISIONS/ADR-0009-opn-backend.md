# ADR-0009: Selectable OPN/OPNA FM Backend

Date: 2026-07-10

Status: Accepted

## Context

The active tree uses the NP2 OPN generator in `sound/opngenc.c` and
`sound/opngeng.c`. Its public interface is `opngen_initialize()`,
`opngen_setvol()`, `opngen_setVR()`, `opngen_reset()`,
`opngen_setcfg()`, `opngen_setextch()`, `opngen_setreg()`,
`opngen_keyon()`, `opngen_getpcm()`, and `opngen_getpcmvr()`. The backend
layer adds `opngen_setcontrol()` for FM control registers that previously
only reached the separate NP2 timer path.

The sound board implementation already separates the Yamaha chip roles:

| Responsibility | Existing owner |
|---|---|
| Board I/O, register address/data ports, and register shadows | `cbus/board*.c`, `iova/boardsb2.c`, and `sound/fmboard.c` |
| FM operator synthesis | `sound/opngenc.c` and `sound/opngeng.c` |
| Timer A/B and IRQ delivery | `sound/fmtimer.c` |
| SSG | `sound/psggenc.c` and `sound/psggeng.c` |
| ADPCM-B | `sound/adpcmc.c` and `sound/adpcmg.c` |
| OPNA rhythm | `sound/rhythmc.c` and its existing sample mixer |
| Final stream mixing and SDL output | `sound/sound.c` and `sdl2/soundmng.c` |

Importing MAME device classes would also import GPL-covered framework code
and duplicate these responsibilities. The reusable `3rdparty/ymfm` subtree is
independent and BSD-3-Clause licensed.

## Decision

Keep the NP2 implementation as a selectable compatibility backend and add
`ymfm` as the default FM operator backend for YM2203 (OPN) and YM2608 (OPNA).

| Field | Value |

| Name | ymfm |
| MAME release | `0.288` (`mame0288`) |
| Upstream URL | `https://github.com/mamedev/mame/tree/mame0288/3rdparty/ymfm` |

| MAME release commit | `27a8d9e85b58058965907d1d8a7a92f8ed039348` |
| ymfm subtree SHA | `764185eef1ee5c30b1bdc2ef86ec90adb7c00948` |
| License | BSD-3-Clause, copyright Aaron Giles |
| Vendored path | `external/ymfm` |

The vendored scope is limited to `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and the OPN
dependencies: `ymfm.h`, `ymfm_fm.h`, `ymfm_fm.ipp`, `ymfm_opn.*`,
`ymfm_ssg.*`, and `ymfm_adpcm.*`. MAME device code, examples, and unrelated
chip families are not included. Vendored files are exact upstream copies and
must not be hand-edited.

The handwritten C++ bridge is confined to `sdl2/ymfmbridge.cpp`, where C++17
is already permitted. `sound/ymfmbridge.h` is the C ABI consumed by the C99
sound core. The existing `opngen_*` API remains the only API used by sound
boards.

Both FM engines receive the same FM register, key-on, and channel-3 mode
writes. The selected backend only controls which engine contributes PCM.
Changing the backend performs the existing GUI guest-reset flow because an
inactive synthesizer does not advance its envelope and phase state. Selection
is stored as `opn_backend=np2|ymfm` in the SDL2 `np2.cfg`; missing or invalid
values select `ymfm`. An existing explicit `opn_backend=np2` remains effective.

This is a staged integration. ymfm supplies FM operator output only. The NP2
timer remains authoritative and forwards expiry cadence to ymfm for FM CSM;
timer status and IRQ delivery remain NP2-owned. SSG, ADPCM-B, rhythm, board
I/O, register shadows, and the final mixer also remain NP2-owned. The wrapper
uses ymfm minimum OPN fidelity and box downsampling from the native ymfm output
rate to the configured host rate.

## Consequences

- Fresh configurations and configurations without a valid backend value use
  `ymfm`; an existing explicit `opn_backend=np2` preserves NP2 synthesis.
- The GUI Sound menu can switch FM synthesis between `NP2` and `ymfm`; the
  automatic guest reset rebuilds the board and keeps configured FDD/SASI
  mounts.
- Save states continue to use the existing NP2 register shadows. Loading a
  state restores both FM backends through the normal `fmboard` replay path.
- A later decision is required before moving SSG, ADPCM, rhythm, timer, status,
  or IRQ ownership to ymfm.
- `OPNGENX86` remains forbidden and undefined.

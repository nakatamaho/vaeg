# ADR-0004: Dear ImGui Vendored Release

Date: 2026-07-04

Status: Accepted

## Context

M10 requires Dear ImGui vendored at a pinned stable release under
`external/imgui`. Branches such as `master` and `docking` are not used.
ADR-0002 selects the SDL2 platform backend and SDL_Renderer2 renderer
backend.

## Decision

Vendor Dear ImGui `v1.92.8`, the latest GitHub stable release observed
for M10 on 2026-07-04.

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Name | Dear ImGui |
| Version | `v1.92.8` |
| Upstream URL | `https://github.com/ocornut/imgui` |
| Release URL | `https://github.com/ocornut/imgui/releases/tag/v1.92.8` |
| Tag SHA | `8936b58fe26e8c3da834b8f60b06511d537b4c63` |
| Source tarball SHA-256 | `fecb33d33930e12ff53a34064e9d3a06c8f7c3e04408f14cd36c80e3faac863b` |
| Vendored path | `external/imgui` |
| License file | `external/imgui/LICENSE.txt` |

Only the files needed by the M10 SDL2 renderer path are vendored:

- Core: `imgui.cpp`, `imgui.h`, `imgui_draw.cpp`, `imgui_internal.h`,
  `imgui_tables.cpp`, `imgui_widgets.cpp`, `imconfig.h`,
  `imstb_rectpack.h`, `imstb_textedit.h`, `imstb_truetype.h`.
- Backends: `backends/imgui_impl_sdl2.*`,
  `backends/imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2.*`.
- License: `LICENSE.txt`.

The demo source, alternate renderer backends, docking branch code,
FreeType integration, and examples are intentionally not vendored.

## Consequences

- Vendored files under `external/imgui` are third-party code and should
  not be hand-edited.
- Upgrading Dear ImGui requires replacing the vendored files from a new
  release tag and updating this ADR.

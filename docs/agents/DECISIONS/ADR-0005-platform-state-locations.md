# ADR-0005: Platform State Locations

Date: 2026-07-06

Amended: 2026-07-11

Status: Accepted

## Decision

M11 should move portable frontend user state out of ROM/executable
locations and into per-user platform state/config directories: Linux uses
the existing XDG base directory behavior for `vaeg.cfg` and stores
portable state files such as `vabkupmem.dat` and save states under the
same `vaeg` user area unless a user-selected absolute path is provided;
Windows uses `%APPDATA%\vaeg` instead of the legacy win9x exe-relative
directory so installed builds remain writable and Unicode-safe; macOS
uses `~/Library/Application Support/vaeg`. The legacy `win9x/` lineage
remains exe-relative and unchanged. Exe-relative portable lookup is at
most a compatibility fallback for explicit assets such as ROM/WAV files,
not the primary location for writable user state.

The active frontend later adds a portable-mode exception for
configuration and backup RAM. It accepts `vaeg.cfg` beside the executable
before checking the per-user directory. An existing executable-local
`vabkupmem.dat` likewise takes priority over the user-state copy. Both
files are saved back to the selected location. Obsolete `np2.cfg`,
`np2.ini`, and `vaeg.ini` files are not read, and backup RAM no longer
falls back to `getbiospath()` for migration. Keyboard sidecars and save
states remain in the per-user state directory.

`vabkupmem.dat` is writable VA user state. The portable frontend passes
the selected path into `iova/bkupmemva.c`; the core file does not depend
on SDL executable-path APIs.

## Writable Biospath Audit

- `iova/bkupmemva.c`: `vabkupmem.dat` is writable state and uses the
  frontend-selected executable-local or per-user path described above.
- Other portable `getbiospath()` users found in the audit are read-only
  ROM, WAV, font, dictionary, or key-map assets:
  `biosva/biosva.c`, `bios/bios.c`, `sound/soundrom.c`,
  `sound/rhythmc.c`, `fdd/fdd_mtr.c`, `iova/va91.c`, and `keystat.c`.
- Fixed GUI save-state slots (`state0.nps` through `state9.nps`) are
  writable state but were not using `getbiospath()`; M11 stores them in
  the same per-platform state directory.

# ADR-0014: librashader CRT runtime and shader boundary

Date: 2026-09-04

Status: Accepted for M99

## Decision

M99 consumes the official librashader C API through the official
`librashader_ld.h` dynamic loader. The implementation is never statically
linked into VAEG. The vendored files are placed under `external/librashader`
because this repository's convention requires third-party material under
`external/`, rather than the task proposal's `third_party/` path.

The pin is the official `librashader-v0.12.0` release:

The macOS archives contain `librashader.dylib` and the Windows archives
contain `librashader.dll`; the archives also contain upstream static-library
files, but M99 does not consume those files. No Linux binary is published in
the audited release assets. The Linux OpenGL runtime must therefore be built
from this exact source pin in the Linux packaging/CI stage, with its resulting
artifact hash recorded before G99-6.

The runtime files used in the M99x optional-runtime package-shape checks are:

| Platform | File | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux | source-built `librashader.so` | `8433577cf2e6872f4e4152e42832d52b48c632fd55b0897da9aae17b0eba3574` |
| macOS x86_64 | `librashader.dylib` from the pinned optimized release | `f1699370b8a01be5df108a7dbb29a8f2c10ef6d701b14d0a830d55084e879f10` |
| Windows x86_64 | `librashader.dll` from the pinned optimized release | `1890f647c7fbe52d4cc591526db24367caca284996855c4565c6003c7e46f8cc` |

These are staged-file hashes, not source-tree payloads. The full release-asset
hashes above remain the provenance identity for the official macOS and Windows
archives.

## Shader closure

The requested `crt-lottes-fast.slang` candidate was audited at the pinned
`libretro/slang-shaders` commit recorded in
`assets/shaders/crt/licenses/crt-default-provenance.md`. Its preset references
only that shader and has no include, LUT, texture, or secondary-pass closure.
The shader contains an explicit Unlicense/public-domain dedication. No
CRT-Geom, CRT-Royale, Mega Bezel, complete `slang-shaders` tree, GPL shader,
or unknown-license shader is copied or distributed.

The current asset names are `assets/shaders/crt/vaeg_crt_default.slangp`,
`assets/shaders/crt/shaders/crt-lottes-fast.slang`, and the adjacent license
and provenance notices. The nested `shaders/` directory is intentional: it
preserves the relative path used by the audited preset, so librashader resolves
the shader from `PRESET_DIR` in both a checkout and a release package. The
preset and shader contents are byte-preserved from the audited upstream
sources; only the preset filename is local.

## Release staging

`tools/release/stage-librashader-assets.sh` copies the exact preset, shader,
license, provenance, and third-party notice closure into a platform package.
It accepts an optional exact-basename runtime (`librashader.so`,
`librashader.dylib`, or `librashader.dll`) and records that supplied file's
SHA-256 beside the package licenses. The runtime is deliberately not a source
tree payload. `tools/release/check-librashader-package.py` validates staged
directories and tar/zip archives, including required hashes and prohibited
shader-family names. Release CI invokes both checks for Linux, Windows, and
macOS packages. A package without the optional runtime remains valid and uses
the existing fail-closed renderer path.

## Consequences

- VAEG remains BSD-2-Clause; the MPL-2.0 implementation is a separately
  loaded runtime with its required license notice.
- A missing library, unsupported runtime, ABI mismatch, or shader failure can
  disable the optional filter without changing the existing SDL renderer.
- Platform runtime hashes and the Linux source-built hash remain release-gate
  evidence, not source-tree binaries.

# ADR-0003: Dear ImGui Japanese Font

Date: 2026-07-04

Status: Accepted

Decision maker: maintainer pre-decision for M10.

## Context

The SDL2 ImGui GUI must render Japanese-capable UTF-8 labels. Reading
the guest font ROM for host UI text is forbidden: the guest ROM is
emulated machine payload, not a host GUI asset, and it may be absent in
ROM-less tests.

Platform font lookup would make rendering and packaging differ across
Linux, MinGW, and macOS. M10 needs a deterministic redistributable font.

## Decision

Bundle Noto Sans JP Regular as:

- `assets/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf`
- `assets/OFL.txt`
- `assets/NOTICE.md`

The font is licensed under the SIL Open Font License, Version 1.1. The
M10 GUI starts with Dear ImGui's `GetGlyphRangesJapanese()` range. Any
additional glyph ranges or fallback-font strategy require updating this
ADR.

Guest font ROM access is forbidden for the host GUI.

## Consequences

- M10 packaging must include the `assets/` font and license files.
- The bundled font is binary payload. After introduction it should not be
  rewritten except by an explicit font asset update.
- Any future switch to platform fonts, guest ROM glyphs, FreeType
  rasterization, or extended glyph coverage requires an ADR update.

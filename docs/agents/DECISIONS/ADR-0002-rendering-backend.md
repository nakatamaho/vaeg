# ADR-0002: Dear ImGui Rendering Backend

Date: 2026-07-04

Status: Accepted

Decision maker: maintainer pre-decision for M10.

## Context

M10 adds a Dear ImGui GUI to the SDL2 frontend. The current SDL2 screen
manager creates an `SDL_Renderer` and an `SDL_Texture`, locks that
texture for guest pixels, then presents through `SDL_RenderCopy` and
`SDL_RenderPresent` (`sdl2/scrnmng.c:68`, `sdl2/scrnmng.c:75`,
`sdl2/scrnmng.c:140`, `sdl2/scrnmng.c:160`). The GUI renderer must fit
that pipeline without adding an unrelated graphics stack.

## Decision

Use Dear ImGui's SDL2 platform backend plus SDL_Renderer2 renderer
backend:

- `imgui_impl_sdl2`
- `imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2`

Require SDL >= 2.0.18 for the M10 ImGui frontend.

The renderer shares the existing `scrnmng` SDL renderer/texture path. No
OpenGL backend and no OpenGL loader dependency are introduced in M10.
`imgui_freetype` is explicitly deferred as a later opt-in.

## Consequences

- M10 implementation must expose or route the existing SDL window and
  renderer to the GUI layer without replacing the guest texture pipeline.
- MinGW and macOS builds avoid GL loader selection and driver-specific GL
  context setup in this milestone.
- HiDPI behavior is constrained by SDL_Renderer and Dear ImGui's
  SDL_Renderer2 backend. Any later switch to OpenGL or another renderer
  requires a new ADR.
- Font rasterization uses Dear ImGui's default stb path in M10. Enabling
  `imgui_freetype` later requires an explicit opt-in change.

## librashader

VAEG optionally loads the official librashader v0.12.0 implementation at
runtime through its C API and dynamic-loader header. The implementation is
under the Mozilla Public License 2.0. The complete license is distributed as
`licenses/librashader-MPL-2.0.txt`; the upstream source and pin are recorded
in `docs/agents/DECISIONS/ADR-0014-librashader-crt.md` in the source tree.

The vendored C headers and loader are under the MIT license as stated by the
upstream `include/README.md`. The corresponding notice is distributed as
`licenses/librashader-headers-MIT.txt`. No librashader implementation code is
linked into VAEG.

## Default CRT shader

The bundled `crt-lottes-fast.slang` shader is from the audited
`libretro/slang-shaders` source and carries an Unlicense/public-domain
dedication. Its preset, license notice, dependency closure, source commit,
and hashes are recorded beside the shader under
`assets/shaders/crt/licenses/` in the source tree. The complete
`slang-shaders` repository and GPL or unidentified shader families are not
distributed.

The active default uses VAeg's BSD-2-Clause `vaeg-crt-aa.slang` and
`vaeg-scanline-aa.inc`, implementing the referenced public-domain Lottes
display equations with pixel-footprint scanline-brightness antialiasing.
The original shader is retained unchanged. VAeg's new code does not alter
the original dedication or attribution; the complete active dependency
closure and both licensing boundaries are recorded in the same provenance.

## Other bundled assets

The general VAEG asset notice, including the MIT-licensed suzukiplan Z80
component and the SIL-licensed Noto Sans JP font, is distributed as
`assets/NOTICE.md` together with the applicable license files.

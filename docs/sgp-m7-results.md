# M7 logical-work and validation results

## Scope and evidence status

This report accompanies the M7a--M7d guest variants. M5 and M6 remain the
regression baselines; no stage-7 baseline was assumed. The table below gives
exact logical quantities implied by the command builder for a steady-state
frame. It is not a bus-transfer measurement. In particular, transparent
BITBLT destination writes depend on the source raster and are reported as
`N/A` rather than inferred from source footprint bytes.

The current VAEG source model is documented in
[`sgp-m7-audit.md`](sgp-m7-audit.md). VAEG modeled cycles, VBLANK slack,
displayed FPS, and the first step-onset count were not captured by a dedicated
host instrumentation pass in this rebuild; those cells are therefore `N/A`.
The earlier human observation of approximately 26 records at 57 FPS and 27 at
28 FPS remains a historical, timing-model-dependent baseline, not a continuous
workload curve.

## Logical matrix

`SGP commands` counts fetched opcodes, while `command words` counts 16-bit
list words. `BITBLT source` includes sprite/glyph source footprints; M7b--M7d
also include two logical bytes for each 1x1 zero PATBLT source. `BITBLT
destination` is the logical destination footprint of sprite/glyph copies plus
PATBLT rectangle footprints; transparent pixels skipped are not claimed as
writes. `Dirty rectangles` is the candidate count recorded by the page-local
cache; a `fallback` row emits full CLS instead of PATBLT rectangles.

The dirty/full-clear crossover in the current implementation is a simple
logical-area guard: candidate rectangle pixel area reaches the 64,000-pixel
surface at 84 active records. This threshold is an algorithmic guard, not a
claim that VAEG or PC-88VA uses the same cost boundary.

## What was actually built and run

All four DOS 8.3 outputs were assembled from the same source with NASM
2.16.03:

~~~sh
NASM=/private/tmp/nasm-install/bin/nasm   demo/sgp-pseudo-sprite/build_m7_coms.sh /tmp/sgpd-m7
~~~

The resulting exact sizes in this rebuild were:

| File | Bytes |
|---|---:|
| `SGPD_7A.COM` | 20,910 |
| `SGPD_7B.COM` | 36,952 |
| `SGPD_7C.COM` | 55,000 |
| `SGPD_7D.COM` | 64,846 |

`SGPD_7C.COM` and `SGPD_7D.COM` were each installed into a fresh disposable
PC-Engine 1.1 boot disk and launched with the existing VAEG headless input
script. The script reached the `+` and `-` injections and completed without a
reported synchronization failure. The bounded headless run did not emit the
DOS exit summary, so no runtime FPS or counter value is claimed here.

## Milestone status and open measurements

- M7a separates calendar/FPS sampling and fixed transfer accounting from the
  sprite builder while retaining full CLS and synchronous rendering.
- M7b uses per-page old/current rectangle caches, verified zero PATBLT clears,
  and full-CLS fallback; it still redraws all sprites in painter order.
- M7c uses two command/work buffers and overlaps CPU state/list construction
  with the currently executing SGP list without changing page ownership.
- M7d precomputes immutable addresses and templates, patches only per-frame
  destination fields, and uses a Y offset table without an X table.
- M7e dirty redraw and M7f triple buffering are not implemented in this
  branch. Their CPU bookkeeping, pacing, and threshold questions remain open.

Consequently, the key optimization questions that require a future host
instrumentation run are explicitly unanswered here: measured SGP-cycle change,
CPU work hidden by M7c, command-template threshold movement, dirty-redraw
break-even, and triple-buffer presentation interval distribution. This keeps
algorithmic quantities separate from the current VAEG timing model and from
real-hardware performance claims.

# SDL2 Dear ImGui GUI

The M10 GUI uses Dear ImGui with `imgui_impl_sdl2` and
`imgui_impl_sdlrenderer2`. It renders on the same `SDL_Renderer` that
`scrnmng` uses for the guest `SDL_Texture`.

## Input Routing

F11 is first handled as a frontend-global hold-to-fast-forward shortcut, so
its keyup always clears the transient state even while ImGui captures input.
All events are then passed to Dear ImGui. Other keyboard events and
SDL_TEXTINPUT reach the guest only when `ImGuiIO::WantCaptureKeyboard` is
false. Mouse events reach guest-side routing only when
`ImGuiIO::WantCaptureMouse` is false. When ImGui wants the keyboard,
mouse, or text input, the guest does not receive that event.

M14 adds a keyboard binding capture mode. While it waits for the next
host scancode, the captured keydown and matching keyup are consumed by
the GUI and never sent to the guest.

Roman-Kana input parses A-Z and apostrophe host scancodes before guest
routing. It emits guest keyboard make/break sequences through
`sdl2/kbdinject.c`; it never injects Unicode text or guest memory bytes.
The menu selects JIS-Kana or Roman-Kana as the kana input method. The
assigned KANA key controls guest kana mode: one press locks KANA, and the
next press unlocks it. Roman-Kana consumes A-Z scancodes only while that
KANA lock mirror is active.

M24 adds `Edit -> Paste`, Command+V on macOS, and Control+V on Linux/Windows.
Clipboard UTF-8 is filtered to printable ASCII and line breaks, converted to
M14 guest key roles, and paced through `kbdinject`. ImGui keyboard/text capture
prevents shortcut paste and pauses an active queue. Reset, state load, focus
loss, and shutdown cancel the queue and release any synthetic key. No Unicode,
IME text, or guest memory injection is used; guest-to-host copy remains later.

M26 routes mouse events only while SDL relative mouse mode is active and
ImGui does not want the mouse. The persistent capture request is independent
of temporary focus, menu, modal, and binding-capture blockers. Those blockers
release guest buttons and pending movement, suspend relative mode, and restore
it after the blocker clears. Button-up, focus-loss, reset, state-load, quit,
and shutdown cleanup are processed even when normal guest mouse input is
blocked, preventing stuck buttons. F12 is a host capture toggle only when its
binding is Mouse; middle click is always a host capture toggle outside ImGui.

## Storage Menus

FDD1/FDD2 Open and Eject act immediately through the existing floppy
mount path. The GUI Reset command reapplies the mounted FDD paths after
the core reset. The paths are saved as `FDD1FILE` / `FDD2FILE` in
`vaeg.cfg`, so mounted FDDs are restored across reset and application
restart; Eject clears the corresponding saved path.

SDL disk-image drops bypass ImGui capture and use the same FDD insertion path.
Direct images persist like manual mounts. ZIP, 7z, and LZH contents are
extracted under managed user-state storage and their mounted paths persist
through reset and application restart. Eject and replacement prune only
managed images that are no longer referenced by FDD1 or FDD2. Drop errors and
ignored-image counts are shown at the bottom of the FDD menu; successful mount
names are not duplicated there. The menu reads the live FDD state on every
frame and shows each mounted basename in normal text, including mounts
restored after application restart; hovering the name shows its full path.

FDD -> New FDD image creates an empty FAT12 data disk as Japanese MS-DOS 2HD
(1.232 MB) or 2DD (640 KB). D88 output retains track/sector metadata; IMG
output is a headerless raw image suitable for mtools. The destination filename
is editable, existing files are never replaced, and the new image can be
mounted immediately as FDD1 or FDD2 through the same persistent mount path.
These are formatted data disks, not bootable MS-DOS system disks. 2D creation
remains deferred pending a separate compatibility audit.

HardDisk -> New SASI image creates HDI images through the existing
`newdisk_hdi()` helper. It supports the legacy 5/10/15/20/30/40 MB SASI
geometry choices and refuses to overwrite an existing file.

HardDisk -> SASI-1/SASI-2 Open updates `HDD1FILE` / `HDD2FILE` in
`vaeg.cfg` through the existing `diskdrv_sethdd()` path. Remove clears the
same key. Reset the guest after changing a SASI image; reset is the
reliable point where `sxsi_open()`, `PCHDD_SASI`, and `sasiio_bind()` are
rebuilt for the guest. The configured SASI image path is retained across
the GUI Reset command. The HardDisk menu shows the live mounted basename
below each Remove command and exposes its full path on hover. SCSI/IDE
mounting and THD/NHD/SCSI image creation remain later items.

## Sound Menu

Sound -> FM sound backend selects `NP2` or `ymfm` and persists the choice as
`opn_backend` in `vaeg.cfg`. Both engines mirror FM register writes, so changing
the output selector uses the existing guest-reset flow to rebuild the selected
synthesizer from a clean board state while retaining mounted FDD/SASI paths.
The ymfm option currently replaces only YM2203/YM2608 FM operator synthesis;
NP2 continues to own timer/IRQ, SSG, ADPCM, rhythm, and stream mixing.
Sound on/off controls only host audio output. It does not clear `SNDboard` or
detach the guest FM hardware, so muting cannot remove the selected OPN/OPNA
check or stall software waiting for the FM timer.

## Boot Model Menu

Emulate -> Boot model selects `VA` or `VA2/VA3`. `VA` writes
`pc_model=88VA1` and selects the unsuffixed VA ROM names; `VA2/VA3` writes
`pc_model=88VA2` and selects MAME-compatible `*_va2.rom` names. Both sets are
read beside the executable. Selection immediately uses the existing
guest-reset flow, including preservation of configured FDD and SASI media.
Missing ROMs are reported with the selected model and expected root.

## Configure And Pacing

Emulate -> Configure opens a transactional CPU/SGP speed modal. Pending
values do not touch core or saved configuration until OK. CPU x1-x32 changes
V30 execution capacity; SGP Model default, Follow CPU, and Custom x1-x16
change SGP execution capacity. Model default is 3.9936 MHz on VA and 7.9872
MHz on VA2/VA3; the dialog displays the resulting effective SGP clock. OK
validates and resets through the existing FDD-preserving path. Cancel, Escape,
and window close discard edits.

Screen exposes the persisted No Wait and frame-skip controls. F11 is a
non-persistent frontend shortcut: while held it selects effective No Wait and
draw skip 16, then immediately returns to the saved values on release.

## Display Controls

Screen exposes Unfiltered, Linear, Scanline, and CRT Lite effects; Native,
Fit, Fit 8-dot, Integer, and Stretch scaling; Native/x2/x3/Custom logical
window sizes; and Windowed, Borderless desktop, or Exclusive fullscreen.
Display settings enumerates SDL displays and resolution/refresh combinations.
Custom size and display changes use pending values, and failed fullscreen
changes roll back without saving the failed selection.

The guest shadow framebuffer and texture remain 640x400. The common viewport
uses SDL renderer output pixels for High-DPI placement and keeps the ImGui
menu outside the guest rectangle. SDL2 remains the only renderer backend;
effects are procedural SDL draw operations and contain no MAME assets.

## Embedded Font

The GUI loads `NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf` with
`ImGuiIO::Fonts->GetGlyphRangesJapanese()`. The guest font ROM is never
used for host GUI text.

`assets/NotoSansJP-Regular.ttf` is the canonical source asset. CMake embeds
its bytes in the executable, and Dear ImGui reads the static data through
`AddFontFromMemoryTTF()`. Runtime font files, platform font lookup, and
`VAEG_ASSET_DIR` are not used. Release packages retain `assets/OFL.txt`
and `assets/NOTICE.md` for license compliance and provenance.
